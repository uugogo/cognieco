Idk, I'm going to side with Florida woman on this one. Evidence is as follows:  Driver in BMW is stopped a ridiculous distance behind the next vehicle BMW driver only moves up as white truck is trying to get in Immediate beeping from BMW for... encroaching on his special space? He called 911 before she actually did ANYTHING I know we can't see him, but his repeating of "video!" was likely accompanied witg aggressive body language right back at her.  I present this evidence to the court in hopes you will find Florida woman innocent on all charges!

So Florida Man is either going to jail or become quite wealthy.
