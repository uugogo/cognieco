NASA reveals that Antarctica is actually gaining more ice than it is losing

 "The good news is that Antarctica is not currently contributing to sea level rise, but is taking 0.23 millimeters per year away," Zwally said. "But this is also bad news. If the 0.27 millimeters per year of sea level rise attributed to Antarctica in the IPCC report is not really coming from Antarctica, there must be some other contribution to sea level rise that is not accounted for."    That's what I was wondering: If you're correct, where does the water come from? So right now it would be his methods + some unknown source of water vs. the known sea level measurements. Are his methods so good, so that it's more likely that there is an unknown source of water? 

The Department of Defense (DoD) spent nearly $43 million to build a gas station in Afghanistan that should have cost no more than $500,000 according to a new report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR).

For more information about Shell in Nigeria, please look at the sources below. http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/dec/08/wikileaks-cables-shell-nigeria-spying  The oil giant Shell claimed it had inserted staff into all the main ministries of the Nigerian government, giving it access to politicians' every move in the oil-rich Niger Delta, according to a leaked US diplomatic cable.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Saro-Wiwa  His death provoked international outrage and the immediate suspension of Nigeria from the Commonwealth of Nations, as well as the calling back of many foreign diplomats for consultation. The United States and other countries considered imposing economic sanctions. Beginning in 1996, the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), EarthRights International (ERI), Paul Hoffman of Schonbrun, DeSimone, Seplow, Harris & Hoffman and other human rights attorneys have brought a series of cases to hold Shell accountable for alleged human rights violations in Nigeria, including summary execution, crimes against humanity, torture, inhumane treatment and arbitrary arrest and detention. The lawsuits are brought against Royal Dutch Shell and Brian Anderson, the head of its Nigerian operation.[15] The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York set a trial date of June 2009. On 9 June 2009 Shell agreed to an out-of-court settlement of $15.5 million USD to victims' families. However, the company denied any liability for the deaths, stating that the payment was part of a reconciliation process.[16] In a statement given after the settlement, Shell suggested that the money was being provided to the relatives of Saro-Wiwa and the eight other victims, in order to cover the legal costs of the case and also in recognition of the events that took place in the region.[17] Some of the funding is also expected to be used to set up a development trust for the Ogoni people, who inhabit the Niger Delta region of Nigeria.[18] The settlement was made just days before the trial, which had been brought by Ken Saro-Wiwa's son, was due to begin in New York.[17]  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiwa_family_lawsuits_against_Royal_Dutch_Shell  On June 8, 2009, Shell settled out-of-court with the Saro-Wiwa family for $15.5 million.[3][4] Ben Amunwa, director of the Remember Saro-Wiwa organization, said that "No company, that is innocent of any involvement with the Nigeria military and human rights abuses, would settle out of court for 15.5 million dollars.

Syria conflict: Russia softens support for Assad, saying it is not crucial for him to remain in power.

 "We are not saying that Assad should leave or stay," she added. Whether Mr Assad stayed or stepped down was not critical for Russia, but that it was up to the Syrian people to decide his fate  This was Russian position from the day 1. And it did not change through out the conflict. Do journalists really have such a short memory? For example: Reuters article from 19th June 2015:  Putin reiterated Russia's line that it is up to the Syrian people to decide the fate of Assad, adding Russia would not call on him to step down. But he said Russia would urge Assad to work with a "healthy" opposition on political reforms.  Here's an article from 28th June 2012:  “We do not support and cannot support any kind of meddling from outside, the imposition of recipes. This applies to the fate of Bashar al-Assad. It, this fate, must be decided by the Syrians, the Syrian people themselves,” Lavrov told a briefing, according to Reuters.

Russia confirms sending 100,000 tons of wheat to Syria as aid

This is weird. In 2015, a lot of wheat was sent from Russia to Syria as aid. The article doesn't even go beyond just that description.

"I confirm that Russia has sent Syria 100,000 tonnes of wheat," he told RIA, confirming an earlier Reuters report that cited sources. (Reporting by Katya Golubkova; Editing by Alexander Winning)>     A reporter and an editor at a major news outlet came up with basically nothing else but the facts. THAT'S the weird part.

Living Wage in London rising to £9.40 an hour

At £9.40/hour, working 8 hours a day for 220 days a year, you will earn £16,544 in a year. After tax you will be taking home £14,307. So your take home each month is £1192. Renting a crap single room in a shit part of the city will probably set you back £100/week+, and travel to and from work is around £4/day+, plus council tax and bills and I reckon you will be spending around £180/week. This leaves you with a little over £100 for food and other stuff each week.  Full time. Living in the shittest part of London. In a single room sharing your house with other people. And all you have left to live off is around £15/day. I wouldn't call that a living wage. It is a surviving wage.

 "The good news is that Antarctica is not currently contributing to sea level rise, but is taking 0.23 millimeters per year away," Zwally said. "But this is also bad news. If the 0.27 millimeters per year of sea level rise attributed to Antarctica in the IPCC report is not really coming from Antarctica, there must be some other contribution to sea level rise that is not accounted for."    That's what I was wondering: If you're correct, where does the water come from? So right now it would be his methods + some unknown source of water vs. the known sea level measurements. Are his methods so good, so that it's more likely that there is an unknown source of water?

Syria conflict: Russia softens support for Assad, saying it is not crucial for him to remain in power.

 "We are not saying that Assad should leave or stay," she added. Whether Mr Assad stayed or stepped down was not critical for Russia, but that it was up to the Syrian people to decide his fate  This was Russian position from the day 1. And it did not change through out the conflict. Do journalists really have such a short memory? For example: Reuters article from 19th June 2015:  Putin reiterated Russia's line that it is up to the Syrian people to decide the fate of Assad, adding Russia would not call on him to step down. But he said Russia would urge Assad to work with a "healthy" opposition on political reforms.  Here's an article from 28th June 2012:  “We do not support and cannot support any kind of meddling from outside, the imposition of recipes. This applies to the fate of Bashar al-Assad. It, this fate, must be decided by the Syrians, the Syrian people themselves,” Lavrov told a briefing, according to Reuters.

Maybe this time, we will not back off after the first sugar-coated and useless measures taken by the government.  Maybe this time we could change something right in the core of our institutions. And it will last. There is the roar of a nation which gradually built over the last year and even further. But I'm afraid it will be necessary to make up a full-blown revolution, only violence can answer violence when it comes to the state in Romania sadly. And people aren't quite prepared for that much bloodshed right now. Currently there are over 32.000 people gathered in front of the Parliament and surroundings. 

China Burns Much More Coal Than Reported, Complicating Climate Talks - China has been using up to 17% more coal a yr than reported. By some estimates, that means almost a billion more tons of carbon dioxide released annually.

Honestly this is actually a good thing, since: 1) the discovery was made and reported by China's own statistical agency.  (albeit with little fanfare) 2)  the historical underestimations were due to gaps in data collection of small factories, rather than intentional errors.  China has long acknowledged its pathetic pollution data collection abilities as needing fixing before even hoping to enforce regulations.  The fact that it's published such a new, drastic, and much needed revision/correction for 2013 is a sign of progress.

Mexican Supreme Court has opened the door to legalizing Marijuana use

 The vote by the court’s criminal chamber declared that individuals should have the right to grow and distribute marijuana for their personal use. While the ruling does not strike down current drug laws, it lays the groundwork for a wave of legal actions that could ultimately rewrite them, proponents of legalization say. The legal ruling on Wednesday barely referred to the bloody backdrop of the drug war. Instead, Justice Arturo Zaldivar wrote an 88-page opinion based on principles of human rights, arguing that the state recognizes an individual’s autonomy to engage in recreational activities that do not harm others.   Sounds like a few people in Mexico are doing the right thing.

Climate change missing from full Trans-Pacific Partnership text, confirming the "worst nightmares" of environmental groups

 "The environment chapter confirms some of the worst nightmares of environmental groups and climate activists," Dr Rimmer said. "The agreement has poor coverage of environmental issues, and weak enforcement mechanisms. There is only limited coverage of biodiversity, conservation, marine capture fisheries, and trade in environmental services. The final text of the chapter does not even mention 'climate change' – the most pressing global environmental issue in the world." Controversially, the deal includes a clause giving foreign companies the right to sue Australian governments if they introduce laws they say have harmed their investments.   This shit is not cool. Now that the final text is out it will be interesting to read more analysis of it in the news but you guys better believe, the corporations will be planting pro-tpp stories to balance out the negative ones. I would encourage everyone to research who thr authors are going forward and the ties they might have.

 The vote by the court’s criminal chamber declared that individuals should have the right to grow and distribute marijuana for their personal use. While the ruling does not strike down current drug laws, it lays the groundwork for a wave of legal actions that could ultimately rewrite them, proponents of legalization say. The legal ruling on Wednesday barely referred to the bloody backdrop of the drug war. Instead, Justice Arturo Zaldivar wrote an 88-page opinion based on principles of human rights, arguing that the state recognizes an individual’s autonomy to engage in recreational activities that do not harm others.   Sounds like a few people in Mexico are doing the right thing.

An interesting thing about Canadian politics is that if you carried on about religion the way they do in the US you would never get elected much less get a party nomination. 

Climate change missing from full Trans-Pacific Partnership text, confirming the "worst nightmares" of environmental groups

At some point the global community is going to have to take climate change more seriously. This bottom up method is moving too slowly. If nothing is done we are going to be facing an unimaginable migration. Hopefully not in our lifetime but the writing is on the wall.  I think we need to stop treating this like we are trying to save the planet and more like we are trying to save mankind.  

NASA just saw something come out of a black hole for the first time ever

How extremely unhelpful of blastr.com (and of viralthread.com where blastr got the article from) to not link the original NASA article, which no doubt will confirm that it's not NASA that says something "came out of" a black hole.   Black Hole Has Major Flare October 27, 2015 http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4753 The baffling and strange behaviors of black holes have become somewhat less mysterious recently, with new observations from NASA's Explorer missions Swift and the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, or NuSTAR. The two space telescopes caught a supermassive black hole in the midst of a giant eruption of X-ray light, helping astronomers address an ongoing puzzle: How do supermassive black holes flare? ... "This is the first time we have been able to link the launching of the corona to a flare," said Dan Wilkins of Saint Mary's University... 

Canada's new prime minister, Justin Trudeau, took office on 4 November — and as one of his first acts, created the post of Minister of Science. Canadian election brings hope for science Kirsty Duncan, a medical geographer at the University of Toronto, will be the first to hold the job.

The previous administration's stance on scientific research was a straight-up fucking national disgrace. So I'm sure this will be an improvement.

Sweden considers cutting development aid budget by 60% due to refugee crisis

Sweden, what are you doing to yourself. If you have a lifeboat that seats 10 people and there are already 8 people on it you don't try to cram on the boat an additional 40 people, that boat will sink. Unfortunately Sweden will have to learn the hard way what countries like Hungary already know when it comes to mass migration, that it is bad. Besides if you really wanted to help you don't bring them into the country, you help them at the camps where it is more cost effective. I've seen studies that say for every Euro spent on a refugee in Sweden it would be the equivalent of 26 euros spent at a refugee camp. You can help 26 times more people, why wouldn't you use your brains instead of your feels and choose the most cost effective way to do things. That is if you choose to do it, Sweden has no more of an obligation to help than does Mongolia, Argentina, or Kenya.
