Battlefield

God damn the sound is good on BF games. 

So I saw this add for the shitty mobile game "Clash of Kings." Isn't that a screenshot from Chivalry? And if so isn't that copyright infringement since they're saying its from their game?

Clash of Zombies. Ripped off Goku, Thor, Iron Man, Hulk, etc.. Names and look and all. /fast foward a bit Now Thor is "Axe" and IronMan is "Armor" with slightly modified looks. So yes, Apparently some do care about their copyright and seek to enforce it. The shitty mobile world feels it and if it keeps getting pushed, more shitty mobile companies will die. Unless you own the rights to DBZ, or Bleach. Then you apparently don't give a fuck.

A true collector's edition

Sorry but THIS is a true collectors edition 

I experienced the Oculus Rift for the first time last night at a friends house. He then put this on and it moved me to tears.

I live in tears too, do you want to meet up for a beer sometime? 

November 2015 Game Releases

I didn't even realise NFS was out already. They almost didn't advertise that game. 

I was cleaning out my moms garage and look what I found! It still works!

It's made by Nintendo, what do you expect. They are basically the nokia of gaming. 

Asking the Right Questions

Game name is The Park, definitely worth a look if you enjoy horror games. No replayability, but a fantastic game. 

My 50+ Fallout wallpaper collection

These are great OP thanks. I especially like this one. It has a level of realism while maintaining that Fallout feel, really nice. 

When the stars align

When the silvers align  

Star wars lightsaber combat in VR with motion tracking controllers. This has so much potential.

Virtual reality never seemed more appealing than it does right now  

Remember to teabag away from the enemy

I watched it loop through like 20 times, it's so satisfying. 

Tali and Mass Effect cosplay

Okay, I know the internet loves Tali, but can we focus on how goddamn amazing that Garrus costume was.  

Sounds about right

TIL The vault has beer. Sweet! 

Starcraft, Diablo 2, WC3 will get HD updates

I read that as they're looking for personnel to help those games run on modern operating systems and hardware, not that they're making HD versions of them. 

Oh you devil, you.

I can hear that picture

Hawkeye is back!

The guy was called "TrickShotProZ", he probably deleted his account after seeing this unreal shit. 

My collection of limited XBOX controllers.... Laaaadies;)

And later he's going to fuck the mutant out of her.  

My Grandmother just gave this to me.

Paper Boy was my favorite game as a kid, every time that lady would chase me with a knife I would panic and scream. 

Boarding the yacht

You made my morning.  The unexpected... terrific. 

Pictured how Call of Duty 4 would look in today's graphics

Why wait six days when it's already November 13th? 

The Fallout Universe and Lore

I'm not drinking out of a god damn toilet no matter how low my hit points are. It's a ROLE PLAYING game and I am playing the ROLE of a man who does not drink out of toilets.

So this took me about 2 months to get it together.  I didn't get the corset and belt I wanted together in time for Halloween so, ah well.  I didn't have time to imprint the gloves either. The top and skirt is all hand made by me.  Many an hour of cutting, sewing and stitching.  The skirt is real heavy canvas (quite warm).  The wraps are hand dyed real leather, runes on it just simple silver sharpie.  I think it came out pretty good. The wig was... uncomfortable... haha. Side by side with reference image

sorry op, but because of the quality, you're a bundle of sticks. as for the alignment reference you have to wait for the last half a frame to see it!

Just wanted to show you because this is incredible craftsmanship. My girlfriend gifted it to me, she said it took her 3 weeks of work.

That's some S-Rank stitching right there.

That's not how perspective works though :(

I bought one for every day during the first month of its release. 

On my honeymoon and this is happening right next to me. The ULTIMATE tease :( the feels...

Relax, you only get one honeymoon.  Blizzcon will happen every single year from now until Blizzard has to file for bankruptcy.

Screenshot of one of the biggest battles that happened in EVE Online.

For anyone confused about the significance of huge battles like this: Subscriptions, or Pilot Licenses Extensions (PLEX), in this game can be bought with real money or with the in-game currency, ISK. This makes PLEX a sort of conversion factor between money and ISK. The ships that were destroyed during this battle had a combined value of 11 trillion ISK. You could buy more than $300,000+ worth of PLEX with that dough. And now it's all gone.

Butch is a perfect example of why I love fallout. One save I let Butch'a grandma die and then murder him. Another save I had him join me as a follower, and we rolled deep through the wasteland as Tunnel Snakes. My personal favorite was making him my follower, remembering his child bullying, shooting him in the back of the head in some random subway station, and then wearing his jacket for the rest of the story like some sort of war trophy
