[Unpopular Opinion] Vote for Bernie Sanders

It's a hot summer afternoon as Sanders jumps on the underground train that connects the Dirksen Senate Office Building with the Capitol. He's headed to the Senate chamber to cast a vote on one of the many bills he has considered during his career. In Congress, Sanders has been known for, and worked hardest on, issues that have been close to him since his days in Brooklyn, Chicago and Burlington. Often, he has urged his colleagues to address the issue of income inequality. In a 2006 Senate campaign debate, Sanders insisted that his plan to raise taxes on wealthy people was not an effort to penalize the rich. "It's a question of creating a society in which all of us are in together, in which we take responsibility to make sure that all of our people have at least a minimal standard of living," he said. "Frankly, from both a moral and an economic perspective, giving tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires when so many people in our society are hurting is wrong." On December 10, 2010, Sanders' message of income inequality finally reached a national audience. At 10:25 a.m. that morning, he rose to speak on the Senate floor. The target: President Obama's plan to extend the Bush-era income tax cuts on everyone, including the wealthy. So many people tuned in to Sanders' filibuster that the Senate's web servers crashed. He didn't sit down until 7 p.m. that night. "We should be embarrassed that we are not investing in our infrastructure, that we're not breaking up these large financial institutions, that we're not putting a cap on interest rates," he said during the day-long speech. "That we are the only country in the world that does not have health care for all of their people in major countries. We should be embarrassed!" Despite Sanders' lengthy oration, the tax package was overwhelmingly adopted and signed into law by President Obama. ... Former NPR Political Director Ken Rudin now runs the Political Junkie Podcast. Rudin has reported on Congress for several decades. "The years in the House, from '91 to 2006, he was seen as a gadfly," Rudin says of Sanders' early years in Washington. "Uncompromising, you know, played to his own tune. He seems to have done some kind of change since he came to the Senate." As a senator, Rudin says Sanders takes a serious approach to dealing with issues — unlike some former members of the chamber. "They called Hubert Humphrey practicing 'the politics of joy.' There's no happy, there's no joy with Bernie Sanders," Rudin says. "The issues he cares about — he deeply cares about — are serious issues and he's not somebody who just takes the time to just schmooze ... he doesn't know how long he has to accomplish what he wants to accomplish, and he's not about to waste any time."

The ignorance and hate in this thread is absolutely astounding. I thought you were better than this reddit. Today you showed me otherwise, and I'm embarrassed for you 

Reddit, what is the worst comment to ever reach the top of this thread?

It's a hot summer afternoon as Sanders jumps on the underground train that connects the Dirksen Senate Office Building with the Capitol. He's headed to the Senate chamber to cast a vote on one of the many bills he has considered during his career. In Congress, Sanders has been known for, and worked hardest on, issues that have been close to him since his days in Brooklyn, Chicago and Burlington. Often, he has urged his colleagues to address the issue of income inequality. In a 2006 Senate campaign debate, Sanders insisted that his plan to raise taxes on wealthy people was not an effort to penalize the rich. "It's a question of creating a society in which all of us are in together, in which we take responsibility to make sure that all of our people have at least a minimal standard of living," he said. "Frankly, from both a moral and an economic perspective, giving tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires when so many people in our society are hurting is wrong." On December 10, 2010, Sanders' message of income inequality finally reached a national audience. At 10:25 a.m. that morning, he rose to speak on the Senate floor. The target: President Obama's plan to extend the Bush-era income tax cuts on everyone, including the wealthy. So many people tuned in to Sanders' filibuster that the Senate's web servers crashed. He didn't sit down until 7 p.m. that night. "We should be embarrassed that we are not investing in our infrastructure, that we're not breaking up these large financial institutions, that we're not putting a cap on interest rates," he said during the day-long speech. "That we are the only country in the world that does not have health care for all of their people in major countries. We should be embarrassed!" Despite Sanders' lengthy oration, the tax package was overwhelmingly adopted and signed into law by President Obama. ... Former NPR Political Director Ken Rudin now runs the Political Junkie Podcast. Rudin has reported on Congress for several decades. "The years in the House, from '91 to 2006, he was seen as a gadfly," Rudin says of Sanders' early years in Washington. "Uncompromising, you know, played to his own tune. He seems to have done some kind of change since he came to the Senate." As a senator, Rudin says Sanders takes a serious approach to dealing with issues — unlike some former members of the chamber. "They called Hubert Humphrey practicing 'the politics of joy.' There's no happy, there's no joy with Bernie Sanders," Rudin says. "The issues he cares about — he deeply cares about — are serious issues and he's not somebody who just takes the time to just schmooze ... he doesn't know how long he has to accomplish what he wants to accomplish, and he's not about to waste any time." 

SO. Significant Other. Look at the things I do with my SO. I have an SO. SO.

It's a hot summer afternoon as Sanders jumps on the underground train that connects the Dirksen Senate Office Building with the Capitol. He's headed to the Senate chamber to cast a vote on one of the many bills he has considered during his career. In Congress, Sanders has been known for, and worked hardest on, issues that have been close to him since his days in Brooklyn, Chicago and Burlington. Often, he has urged his colleagues to address the issue of income inequality. In a 2006 Senate campaign debate, Sanders insisted that his plan to raise taxes on wealthy people was not an effort to penalize the rich. "It's a question of creating a society in which all of us are in together, in which we take responsibility to make sure that all of our people have at least a minimal standard of living," he said. "Frankly, from both a moral and an economic perspective, giving tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires when so many people in our society are hurting is wrong." On December 10, 2010, Sanders' message of income inequality finally reached a national audience. At 10:25 a.m. that morning, he rose to speak on the Senate floor. The target: President Obama's plan to extend the Bush-era income tax cuts on everyone, including the wealthy. So many people tuned in to Sanders' filibuster that the Senate's web servers crashed. He didn't sit down until 7 p.m. that night. "We should be embarrassed that we are not investing in our infrastructure, that we're not breaking up these large financial institutions, that we're not putting a cap on interest rates," he said during the day-long speech. "That we are the only country in the world that does not have health care for all of their people in major countries. We should be embarrassed!" Despite Sanders' lengthy oration, the tax package was overwhelmingly adopted and signed into law by President Obama. ... Former NPR Political Director Ken Rudin now runs the Political Junkie Podcast. Rudin has reported on Congress for several decades. "The years in the House, from '91 to 2006, he was seen as a gadfly," Rudin says of Sanders' early years in Washington.

DAE here for trikle down karma? Edit: am gril 

u/Gallowboob has been shadowbanned. I, for one, welcome the new shitpost-free reddit.

Here's the thing. You said "Gallowboob posts are shitposts". Are they in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a scientist who studies dank memes, I am telling you, specifically, in science, nobody calls Gallowboob posts shitposts. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying "karma-whoring family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Repostidae, which includes things from shitposts to "upvote now" posts to TILs.  So your reasoning for calling a Gallowboob post a shitpost is because some random neckbeards "call all karma-whoring posts shitposts". Let's get "upvote for visibility" posts and copypastas in there too. Also, calling a post a quality post or a non-karma-whoring post? It's not one or the other, that's not how reddit works. They're both. A Gallowboob post is a Gallowboob post and a member of the karma-whoring family. But that's not what you said. You said a Gallowboob post is a shitpost, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the karma-whoring family shitposts, which means you'd call reposts, circlejerks and fake Advice Animals shitposts too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know.

I feel so honoured to be the first comment. All of my hard work and dedication has paid off. Getting the top comment has been a dream of mine for many years, and i would like to thank those who have helped me along the way. First and foremost i would like to thank god for giving me this opportunity. Next i would like to thank my parents. I want to thank my friend /u/ehhbutwhy , for being really dank and always there for me. I would also like to thank my pet tadpole for surviving against all odds for over a week. Next i would like to thank the squirrel that lives in my backyard for climbing trees because that gives me inspiration that i need to get through the day. This is a special moment in my life and i would like to thank any of my unmentioned friends and family that have helped me along the way. This moment will be a moment that i will never forget. I just remembered a few other people i would like to thank; Ellen Pao, the fish i caught in the third grade, my light in my room bc i wouldn’t be able to see the keyboard without it, the internet for letting me go on facebook, my house because without it i would be homeless, and last but not least i would like to thank all the people out there that actually took time out of their day to read this. I cannot stress how much of a big deal to me this is. I have been trying to be the first comment on a post for years, but that has not been possible until this amazing day. Hopefully my good luck will continue, but this is undoubtedly a rare occasion. If you asked me how i did this, i would say, you can achieve anything u set your mind on. To all the kids out there reading this, i would like to tell them to follow their dreams. Being the top comment is amazing, thank you everyone.

Anyone know how I can get in contact with Sony? I'm currently writing a script for the third Paul Blart movie, Paul Blart French Cop, where Paul Blart has to secure the Louvre from bandits. I have also written out a overarching storyline throughout the series. In Paul Blart Three he will marry a french girl and have a son and he will name him Paul Blart Jr. In the fourth one NASA needs a mall cop on the ISS as the terrorists have figured out space travel and are going to take it over. During this he must leave his son in the hands of his Mexican daughter. She teaches him the art of Mall-copery in his absence. In the fifth after Paul has fought off the terrorists he is allowed to head back to Earth, but as he is about to leave he finds out that there is a bounty on his head on Earth so he must stay in space until they forget about him. He flies to Mars in hiding and while on Mars finds his father Paul Blart Senior (played by John Goodman), they then fight the martians setting up for the second to last movie in the series Blart Generations. In Blart Generations Paul Blart Sr. and Paul Blart Jr. are able to head back home twenty years after the events of the third film. They arrive and Paul Blart III (played by a fat Chris Pine) is twenty years old and already the top Mall Cop at his Mall. As Paul Blart is back after so long the president requests for him to receive a medal for his bravery on the ISS. He decides to take his whole family with him to the ceremony. As he is receiving the award with his father, son, and daughter terrorists invade the white house and his daughter gets kidnapped. The Blart men have to save the white house from terrorists. During this time they find out the President, Jeff Blartan, is actually Paul's long lost brother Jeff Blart. They reunite and after the Blarts stop the terrorists Paul recieves another medal and Jeff declares Paul as his new Vice President as the old one and his whole cabinet and all of congress died in the attacks. Right after Jeff announces that he is shot. Paul then throws his segway at the shooter killing him immedietly. Jeff dies in Paul's arms and Paul takes over the presidency. Then the final movie set thirty years after the events of Blart Generations Paul Blart returns from retirement to stop his former Mall from closing down. During a rally to stop city hall from doing it Paul sees another Paul Blart. Paul chases after him on his segway, but loses him. Paul goes back home and goes to bed. In the night the Paul appears again. The Paul is actually a Paul from another dimension. He warns him that across the galaxy there has been a Paul genocide happening where they have been murdering the Pauls from every dimension. He then takes Paul to a planet of Pauls where the other Pauls are hiding and preparing for if they are ever found. The planet is then found and war erupts with every paul charging at the army of masked mall bandits. The battle is long and eventful, many Pauls have died. In the climax of the battle our Paul climbs into the battle ship of the bandits and attacks their leader. He is in a swivel chair and he turns around. It's that cellphone kid from the first movie. He tells Paul ever since that night he has been traumatized for some reason and has been obsessing over the Blart. He realizes that he cannot live in a world with Blart so he stole a rocket ship from the Russians and flew to a planet like ours were everyone is masked mall bandits. He then taught them to hate the Blart and sent them out throughout the universe to kill the blarts. Our Paul then fights the kid and the have a glorious fight. It ends with Paul tazing the kid and the curb stomping him. Paul then steals his ship and returns home. He walks into his house, turns on the TV, and watches some Antique Roadshow before dying in his sleep later that night.   So the films go.  Paul Blart Mall Cop. Paul Blart Mall Cop 2. Paul Blart French Cop. Paul Blart Space Cop. Paul Blart Mars Cop. Paul Blart Generations. Paul Blart.

Me too thx 

u/Gallowboob has been shadowbanned. I, for one, welcome the new shitpost-free reddit.

Here's the thing. You said "Gallowboob posts are shitposts". Are they in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a scientist who studies dank memes, I am telling you, specifically, in science, nobody calls Gallowboob posts shitposts. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying "karma-whoring family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Repostidae, which includes things from shitposts to "upvote now" posts to TILs.  So your reasoning for calling a Gallowboob post a shitpost is because some random neckbeards "call all karma-whoring posts shitposts". Let's get "upvote for visibility" posts and copypastas in there too. Also, calling a post a quality post or a non-karma-whoring post? It's not one or the other, that's not how reddit works. They're both. A Gallowboob post is a Gallowboob post and a member of the karma-whoring family. But that's not what you said. You said a Gallowboob post is a shitpost, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the karma-whoring family shitposts, which means you'd call reposts, circlejerks and fake Advice Animals shitposts too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know.

Anyone know how I can get in contact with Sony? I'm currently writing a script for the third Paul Blart movie, Paul Blart French Cop, where Paul Blart has to secure the Louvre from bandits. I have also written out a overarching storyline throughout the series. In Paul Blart Three he will marry a french girl and have a son and he will name him Paul Blart Jr. In the fourth one NASA needs a mall cop on the ISS as the terrorists have figured out space travel and are going to take it over. During this he must leave his son in the hands of his Mexican daughter. She teaches him the art of Mall-copery in his absence. In the fifth after Paul has fought off the terrorists he is allowed to head back to Earth, but as he is about to leave he finds out that there is a bounty on his head on Earth so he must stay in space until they forget about him. He flies to Mars in hiding and while on Mars finds his father Paul Blart Senior (played by John Goodman), they then fight the martians setting up for the second to last movie in the series Blart Generations. In Blart Generations Paul Blart Sr. and Paul Blart Jr. are able to head back home twenty years after the events of the third film. They arrive and Paul Blart III (played by a fat Chris Pine) is twenty years old and already the top Mall Cop at his Mall. As Paul Blart is back after so long the president requests for him to receive a medal for his bravery on the ISS. He decides to take his whole family with him to the ceremony. As he is receiving the award with his father, son, and daughter terrorists invade the white house and his daughter gets kidnapped. The Blart men have to save the white house from terrorists. During this time they find out the President, Jeff Blartan, is actually Paul's long lost brother Jeff Blart. They reunite and after the Blarts stop the terrorists Paul recieves another medal and Jeff declares Paul as his new Vice President as the old one and his whole cabinet and all of congress died in the attacks. Right after Jeff announces that he is shot. Paul then throws his segway at the shooter killing him immedietly. Jeff dies in Paul's arms and Paul takes over the presidency. Then the final movie set thirty years after the events of Blart Generations Paul Blart returns from retirement to stop his former Mall from closing down. During a rally to stop city hall from doing it Paul sees another Paul Blart. Paul chases after him on his segway, but loses him. Paul goes back home and goes to bed. In the night the Paul appears again. The Paul is actually a Paul from another dimension. He warns him that across the galaxy there has been a Paul genocide happening where they have been murdering the Pauls from every dimension. He then takes Paul to a planet of Pauls where the other Pauls are hiding and preparing for if they are ever found. The planet is then found and war erupts with every paul charging at the army of masked mall bandits. The battle is long and eventful, many Pauls have died. In the climax of the battle our Paul climbs into the battle ship of the bandits and attacks their leader. He is in a swivel chair and he turns around. It's that cellphone kid from the first movie. He tells Paul ever since that night he has been traumatized for some reason and has been obsessing over the Blart. He realizes that he cannot live in a world with Blart so he stole a rocket ship from the Russians and flew to a planet like ours were everyone is masked mall bandits. He then taught them to hate the Blart and sent them out throughout the universe to kill the blarts. Our Paul then fights the kid and the have a glorious fight. It ends with Paul tazing the kid and the curb stomping him. Paul then steals his ship and returns home. He walks into his house, turns on the TV, and watches some Antique Roadshow before dying in his sleep later that night.   So the films go.  Paul Blart Mall Cop. Paul Blart Mall Cop 2. Paul Blart French Cop. Paul Blart Space Cop. Paul Blart Mars Cop. Paul Blart Generations. Paul Blart.

Over the past few months I've seen more then enough drama, bullshit, trash talk abd double standards then i thought possible from a group dedicated to loving the same game company and convention. I'll be leaving this group and not joining the others or the website. Some of you are great and i hope everyone enjoys it. To the toxic people in this group. Go fuck yourself

I was telling Neil deGrasse Tyson how physics apply to our world when Bernie interrupted (in the most polite way imaginable, with a tip of his fedora) to point out that jet fuel melts anything. Except inside jobs. 

Bernie Sanders: "You will updoot this post". Politifact Rating: $100% True.

so brave 

This is Bernie Sanders, a 420 year old who sacrificed himself to save his 69 year old sister by pushing her out the way of a speeding John Cena crashing onto a sidewalk on Halloween 2015, in Bronx NY. They were blazing dank kush.

Me too thx 

u/Gallowboob has been shadowbanned. I, for one, welcome the new shitpost-free reddit.

Here's the thing. You said "Gallowboob posts are shitposts". Are they in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a scientist who studies dank memes, I am telling you, specifically, in science, nobody calls Gallowboob posts shitposts. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying "karma-whoring family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Repostidae, which includes things from shitposts to "upvote now" posts to TILs.  So your reasoning for calling a Gallowboob post a shitpost is because some random neckbeards "call all karma-whoring posts shitposts". Let's get "upvote for visibility" posts and copypastas in there too. Also, calling a post a quality post or a non-karma-whoring post? It's not one or the other, that's not how reddit works. They're both. A Gallowboob post is a Gallowboob post and a member of the karma-whoring family. But that's not what you said. You said a Gallowboob post is a shitpost, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the karma-whoring family shitposts, which means you'd call reposts, circlejerks and fake Advice Animals shitposts too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know.

I know this isnt the right place to post this, but can anyone help me raise a few dollars for my kickstarter? 

Check out this gem! I made this halloween costume for my autistic brother. What do you think reddit? Does he like it?

What is this nonsensical lame ass bulsshit? You need to spend less time on the internet if this kind of thing bothers you.

u/Gallowboob has been shadowbanned. I, for one, welcome the new shitpost-free reddit.

Here's the thing. You said "Gallowboob posts are shitposts". Are they in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a scientist who studies dank memes, I am telling you, specifically, in science, nobody calls Gallowboob posts shitposts. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying "karma-whoring family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Repostidae, which includes things from shitposts to "upvote now" posts to TILs.  So your reasoning for calling a Gallowboob post a shitpost is because some random neckbeards "call all karma-whoring posts shitposts". Let's get "upvote for visibility" posts and copypastas in there too. Also, calling a post a quality post or a non-karma-whoring post? It's not one or the other, that's not how reddit works. They're both. A Gallowboob post is a Gallowboob post and a member of the karma-whoring family. But that's not what you said. You said a Gallowboob post is a shitpost, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the karma-whoring family shitposts, which means you'd call reposts, circlejerks and fake Advice Animals shitposts too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know. 

TIL that I had SEX with my GIRLFRIEND

AMA Request Robin Williams

Bernie Sanders is a really incredible, smart, earnest candidate for the 2016 presidential election of the United States of America. As a candidate for president of the United States of America, Bernie Sanders really stands out, especially because Bernie Sanders is very, very incredibly intelligent and sincere. The policies that Bernie Sanders would put into place if he were elected to be the President of the United States of America reflect the fact that Bernie Sanders is extremely genuine and wise. I would vote for Bernie Sanders to be the president of the United States of America because of his great policies, which are incredibly smart, wise and intelligent, and which show that Bernie Sanders is a candidate for the presidency of the United States of America who is extremely smart, intelligent and wise. It is also important to note that Bernie Sanders campaign for the 2016 presidency of the United States of America displays his genuineness, sincerity, and compassion for each and every individual citizen of the United States of America, even those citizens of the United States of America who do not believe that Bernie Sanders is really, truly the most genuine, sincere and compassionate candidate running to be president of the United States of America. 

If Bernie Sanders isn't elected than the wrong side won World War 2

This is my main and some of my friends probably know about it, but fuck it. I grew up in a very violent household. My father beat my mother very severely. I'm cursed with a very good, early memory. Younger me swore not to repeat my parents' mistakes. Unfortunately, I had no plan as to how I would avoid doing that. The first girl to show me any attention turned out to be just like my mother (during a bad period in her life, anyway). My mother is a very bad, neurotic person that neglected me and allowed horrific things to happen to me. This girl and I had our first kid at 17 years old. I joined the military and resolved to do the right thing as I saw it at the time. The problem was that neither of us were well mentally. We had the best intentions and we thought we loved one another. In reality, we were codependent. Between 2005 and 2009, we had 4 children. I question the paternity of a few of the children now, but only when I'm drunk and only to myself (and the internet apparently). In 2011, I discovered she had been having an affair with my best friend. A guy I had served in the military with for years. If I'm being honest with myself, I was am asshole and a shitty husband. It was bound to happen. I thought we could work it out. So did she. We tried... She cheated more. I found about more past indiscretions. Long story short, I slapped and choked her when this all came to a head. The next day she kissed me goodbye as I left for work and called the police not long after. It felt like a betrayal at the time, but it was the smartest thing she ever did. I called her from work and tried to plan lunch with her. She told me that she had called the cops and that they were looking for me. I went into my First Sergeant's office to tell him what was going on and he had already been contacted. My supervisor drove me to my house and I changed into civilian clothes and then he drove me to the police station. I confessed to almost everything immediately. It took me a few years to admit that I had choked her unconscious. I couldn't admit that to myself for some reason. They released me from jail while the case was pending and I went back to work. Eventually, she contacted me enough times that I broke the restraining order and answered the call. That led to us living together again in secret. That's when I found out that she was still carrying on an affair. I had been suicidal since I was a kid. I'm not sure when it started, but I remember that it occurred to me that I could kill myself when I was 10 or so. When I was 20, I figured out how I would do that. After I found out the last bit of news, I hanged myself in the garage. She found me and cut me down. The cops and ambulance followed and I was committed for the first time. I was in a mental health hospital for over two weeks until they transferred me to a military mental health facility. Two more weeks there and back to jail. Once in jail, I started counseling at least every week. I ended up serving a year on the restraining order violation. 5 years probation on the actual domestic violence (felony threats in there somewhere too). After getting out, I've been working in restaurants and hating life, more or less. Ended up talking about suicide and a girl I was seeing called the police. Back in the mental health hospital for a few weeks. They figured out somehow that I was still entitled to VA benefits due to my reenlistment (first term of service was honorable). After that I had free weekly therapy. Been going since then. So after four years of counseling (still going), I've worked through a ton of childhood issues. I'm not angry anymore. I've forgiven myself for what I did. The repercussions are just endless. I've not seen the kids since we put them to bed that night. It wasn't even the normal routine. I was simmering with anxious tension during the whole process, waiting to confront her. Wish I could have sung to our youngest like always. I probably would still be the same person had I not been in the criminal justice system. Having terrible thoughts and saying awful things in the privacy of your home is one thing. Having those thoughts and words read aloud in a court room for public record... That really makes you take a hard look in the mirror. Sitting with other batterers around a table and listening to the sickening shit we thought and said... I couldn't have changed without the impetus of being dicked in the ass by the justice system. I just wish it would end. I've done some fucked up stuff, but I really would like to just melt into the background and be a decent person. TLDR: I grew up in a very violent household. My father beat my mother very severely. I'm cursed with a very good, early memory. Younger me swore not to repeat my parents' mistakes.

u/Gallowboob has been shadowbanned. I, for one, welcome the new shitpost-free reddit.

Here's the thing. You said "Gallowboob posts are shitposts". Are they in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a scientist who studies dank memes, I am telling you, specifically, in science, nobody calls Gallowboob posts shitposts. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying "karma-whoring family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Repostidae, which includes things from shitposts to "upvote now" posts to TILs.  So your reasoning for calling a Gallowboob post a shitpost is because some random neckbeards "call all karma-whoring posts shitposts". Let's get "upvote for visibility" posts and copypastas in there too. Also, calling a post a quality post or a non-karma-whoring post? It's not one or the other, that's not how reddit works. They're both. A Gallowboob post is a Gallowboob post and a member of the karma-whoring family. But that's not what you said. You said a Gallowboob post is a shitpost, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the karma-whoring family shitposts, which means you'd call reposts, circlejerks and fake Advice Animals shitposts too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know.

Bernie Sanders is a really incredible, smart, earnest candidate for the 2016 presidential election of the United States of America. As a candidate for president of the United States of America, Bernie Sanders really stands out, especially because Bernie Sanders is very, very incredibly intelligent and sincere. The policies that Bernie Sanders would put into place if he were elected to be the President of the United States of America reflect the fact that Bernie Sanders is extremely genuine and wise. I would vote for Bernie Sanders to be the president of the United States of America because of his great policies, which are incredibly smart, wise and intelligent, and which show that Bernie Sanders is a candidate for the presidency of the United States of America who is extremely smart, intelligent and wise. It is also important to note that Bernie Sanders campaign for the 2016 presidency of the United States of America displays his genuineness, sincerity, and compassion for each and every individual citizen of the United States of America, even those citizens of the United States of America who do not believe that Bernie Sanders is really, truly the most genuine, sincere and compassionate candidate running to be president of the United States of America.

If Bernie Sanders isn't elected than the wrong side won World War 2

This is my main and some of my friends probably know about it, but fuck it. I grew up in a very violent household. My father beat my mother very severely. I'm cursed with a very good, early memory. Younger me swore not to repeat my parents' mistakes. Unfortunately, I had no plan as to how I would avoid doing that. The first girl to show me any attention turned out to be just like my mother (during a bad period in her life, anyway). My mother is a very bad, neurotic person that neglected me and allowed horrific things to happen to me. This girl and I had our first kid at 17 years old. I joined the military and resolved to do the right thing as I saw it at the time. The problem was that neither of us were well mentally. We had the best intentions and we thought we loved one another. In reality, we were codependent. Between 2005 and 2009, we had 4 children. I question the paternity of a few of the children now, but only when I'm drunk and only to myself (and the internet apparently). In 2011, I discovered she had been having an affair with my best friend. A guy I had served in the military with for years. If I'm being honest with myself, I was am asshole and a shitty husband. It was bound to happen. I thought we could work it out. So did she. We tried... She cheated more. I found about more past indiscretions. Long story short, I slapped and choked her when this all came to a head. The next day she kissed me goodbye as I left for work and called the police not long after. It felt like a betrayal at the time, but it was the smartest thing she ever did. I called her from work and tried to plan lunch with her. She told me that she had called the cops and that they were looking for me. I went into my First Sergeant's office to tell him what was going on and he had already been contacted. My supervisor drove me to my house and I changed into civilian clothes and then he drove me to the police station. I confessed to almost everything immediately. It took me a few years to admit that I had choked her unconscious. I couldn't admit that to myself for some reason. They released me from jail while the case was pending and I went back to work. Eventually, she contacted me enough times that I broke the restraining order and answered the call. That led to us living together again in secret. That's when I found out that she was still carrying on an affair. I had been suicidal since I was a kid. I'm not sure when it started, but I remember that it occurred to me that I could kill myself when I was 10 or so. When I was 20, I figured out how I would do that. After I found out the last bit of news, I hanged myself in the garage. She found me and cut me down. The cops and ambulance followed and I was committed for the first time. I was in a mental health hospital for over two weeks until they transferred me to a military mental health facility. Two more weeks there and back to jail. Once in jail, I started counseling at least every week. I ended up serving a year on the restraining order violation. 5 years probation on the actual domestic violence (felony threats in there somewhere too). After getting out, I've been working in restaurants and hating life, more or less. Ended up talking about suicide and a girl I was seeing called the police. Back in the mental health hospital for a few weeks. They figured out somehow that I was still entitled to VA benefits due to my reenlistment (first term of service was honorable). After that I had free weekly therapy. Been going since then. So after four years of counseling (still going), I've worked through a ton of childhood issues. I'm not angry anymore. I've forgiven myself for what I did. The repercussions are just endless. I've not seen the kids since we put them to bed that night. It wasn't even the normal routine. I was simmering with anxious tension during the whole process, waiting to confront her. Wish I could have sung to our youngest like always. I probably would still be the same person had I not been in the criminal justice system. Having terrible thoughts and saying awful things in the privacy of your home is one thing. Having those thoughts and words read aloud in a court room for public record... That really makes you take a hard look in the mirror. Sitting with other batterers around a table and listening to the sickening shit we thought and said... I couldn't have changed without the impetus of being dicked in the ass by the justice system. I just wish it would end. I've done some fucked up stuff, but I really would like to just melt into the background and be a decent person. TLDR: I grew up in a very violent household. My father beat my mother very severely. I'm cursed with a very good, early memory. Younger me swore not to repeat my parents' mistakes.

Same thing every day...

I feel so honoured to be the first comment. All of my hard work and dedication has paid off. Getting the top comment has been a dream of mine for many years, and i would like to thank those who have helped me along the way. First and foremost i would like to thank god for giving me this opportunity. Next i would like to thank my parents. I want to thank my friend /u/ehhbutwhy , for being really dank and always there for me. I would also like to thank my pet tadpole for surviving against all odds for over a week. Next i would like to thank the squirrel that lives in my backyard for climbing trees because that gives me inspiration that i need to get through the day. This is a special moment in my life and i would like to thank any of my unmentioned friends and family that have helped me along the way. This moment will be a moment that i will never forget. I just remembered a few other people i would like to thank; Ellen Pao, the fish i caught in the third grade, my light in my room bc i wouldn’t be able to see the keyboard without it, the internet for letting me go on facebook, my house because without it i would be homeless, and last but not least i would like to thank all the people out there that actually took time out of their day to read this. I cannot stress how much of a big deal to me this is. I have been trying to be the first comment on a post for years, but that has not been possible until this amazing day. Hopefully my good luck will continue, but this is undoubtedly a rare occasion. If you asked me how i did this, i would say, you can achieve anything u set your mind on. To all the kids out there reading this, i would like to tell them to follow their dreams. Being the top comment is amazing, thank you everyone.

If Bernie Sanders isn't elected than the wrong side won World War 2

This is my main and some of my friends probably know about it, but fuck it. I grew up in a very violent household. My father beat my mother very severely. I'm cursed with a very good, early memory. Younger me swore not to repeat my parents' mistakes. Unfortunately, I had no plan as to how I would avoid doing that. The first girl to show me any attention turned out to be just like my mother (during a bad period in her life, anyway). My mother is a very bad, neurotic person that neglected me and allowed horrific things to happen to me. This girl and I had our first kid at 17 years old. I joined the military and resolved to do the right thing as I saw it at the time. The problem was that neither of us were well mentally. We had the best intentions and we thought we loved one another. In reality, we were codependent. Between 2005 and 2009, we had 4 children. I question the paternity of a few of the children now, but only when I'm drunk and only to myself (and the internet apparently). In 2011, I discovered she had been having an affair with my best friend. A guy I had served in the military with for years. If I'm being honest with myself, I was am asshole and a shitty husband. It was bound to happen. I thought we could work it out. So did she. We tried... She cheated more. I found about more past indiscretions. Long story short, I slapped and choked her when this all came to a head. The next day she kissed me goodbye as I left for work and called the police not long after. It felt like a betrayal at the time, but it was the smartest thing she ever did. I called her from work and tried to plan lunch with her. She told me that she had called the cops and that they were looking for me. I went into my First Sergeant's office to tell him what was going on and he had already been contacted. My supervisor drove me to my house and I changed into civilian clothes and then he drove me to the police station. I confessed to almost everything immediately. It took me a few years to admit that I had choked her unconscious. I couldn't admit that to myself for some reason. They released me from jail while the case was pending and I went back to work. Eventually, she contacted me enough times that I broke the restraining order and answered the call. That led to us living together again in secret. That's when I found out that she was still carrying on an affair. I had been suicidal since I was a kid. I'm not sure when it started, but I remember that it occurred to me that I could kill myself when I was 10 or so. When I was 20, I figured out how I would do that. After I found out the last bit of news, I hanged myself in the garage. She found me and cut me down. The cops and ambulance followed and I was committed for the first time. I was in a mental health hospital for over two weeks until they transferred me to a military mental health facility. Two more weeks there and back to jail. Once in jail, I started counseling at least every week. I ended up serving a year on the restraining order violation. 5 years probation on the actual domestic violence (felony threats in there somewhere too). After getting out, I've been working in restaurants and hating life, more or less. Ended up talking about suicide and a girl I was seeing called the police. Back in the mental health hospital for a few weeks. They figured out somehow that I was still entitled to VA benefits due to my reenlistment (first term of service was honorable). After that I had free weekly therapy. Been going since then. So after four years of counseling (still going), I've worked through a ton of childhood issues. I'm not angry anymore. I've forgiven myself for what I did. The repercussions are just endless. I've not seen the kids since we put them to bed that night. It wasn't even the normal routine. I was simmering with anxious tension during the whole process, waiting to confront her. Wish I could have sung to our youngest like always. I probably would still be the same person had I not been in the criminal justice system. Having terrible thoughts and saying awful things in the privacy of your home is one thing. Having those thoughts and words read aloud in a court room for public record... That really makes you take a hard look in the mirror. Sitting with other batterers around a table and listening to the sickening shit we thought and said... I couldn't have changed without the impetus of being dicked in the ass by the justice system. I just wish it would end. I've done some fucked up stuff, but I really would like to just melt into the background and be a decent person. TLDR: I grew up in a very violent household. My father beat my mother very severely. I'm cursed with a very good, early memory. Younger me swore not to repeat my parents' mistakes.

Im sorry sir, but you are just plain wrong. Science is what dictates a popular opinion. You might be sharing YOUR opinion, but its not THE opinion. I really wish people would do a little more research before making posts like this. Its embarrassing for everyone involved. Your friend, John Cena

Bob Ross was the curtain puller.  Edit: What fucking idiot gilded this???  EDIT: Why the downvotes, though? I know he didn't attend the show, it was a joke. I didn't think I had to put /s every time, but apparently you all suck.  

Reddit has donated a total of $400,000 to Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. The senator's response? "Thanks for the gold, kind stranger."

Here in my garage just bought this new Lamborghini here. Fun to drive up here in the hollywood hills. But you know what I like a lot more than knowledge? This new Lamborghini here. But you know what I like a lot more than the new Lamborghini here? My TEDx talk where I talk about this new Lamborghini here. In fact, I’m a lot more proud about these 7 new hollywood hills that I had to get installed to hold 2000 new Lamborghinis. It’s like what the Buffet Warren billionaire says, “The more you earn, the more you drive up here in the hollywood hills.” In fact, the real reason I keep this Lamborghini here, is that it’s a reminder-- a reminder that dreams are still possible. Because it wasn’t that long ago that I was in a little Lamborghini, sleeping on bookshelves in the hollywood hills with only 47 billion dollars in my bank account, and only 47 Lamborghinis in my Lamborghini account, and only 47 hills in my hollywood account, and only 47 TEDx talks where I talk about Warren Buffets in my TEDx talks where I talk about Warren Buffet account. But you know what? Something happened that changed my life. I bumped into a Lamborghini, and another Lamborghini. A few more Lamborghinis and I found 5 Lamborghinis. I don’t call it money anymore, I call it fuel units. You must have enough fuel units. You must have enough Lamborghinis. You must construct additional pylons.

TIL you can lead a meme to water but you can't make it dank

I'm sorry, but this is complete shit and as an established author I will tell you why it is such shit. It should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here, as far as I know. That said. In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it. I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan). I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories. I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it. I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things. I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit "women are crazy" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome. That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that). I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments). And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator. All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me?

BERNIE SANDERS CONFIRMED PLAYABLE CHARACTER IN FALLOUT 4

source? 

Reddit has donated a total of $400,000 to Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. The senator's response? "Thanks for the gold, kind stranger."

Here in my garage just bought this new Lamborghini here. Fun to drive up here in the hollywood hills. But you know what I like a lot more than knowledge? This new Lamborghini here. But you know what I like a lot more than the new Lamborghini here? My TEDx talk where I talk about this new Lamborghini here. In fact, I’m a lot more proud about these 7 new hollywood hills that I had to get installed to hold 2000 new Lamborghinis. It’s like what the Buffet Warren billionaire says, “The more you earn, the more you drive up here in the hollywood hills.” In fact, the real reason I keep this Lamborghini here, is that it’s a reminder-- a reminder that dreams are still possible. Because it wasn’t that long ago that I was in a little Lamborghini, sleeping on bookshelves in the hollywood hills with only 47 billion dollars in my bank account, and only 47 Lamborghinis in my Lamborghini account, and only 47 hills in my hollywood account, and only 47 TEDx talks where I talk about Warren Buffets in my TEDx talks where I talk about Warren Buffet account. But you know what? Something happened that changed my life. I bumped into a Lamborghini, and another Lamborghini. A few more Lamborghinis and I found 5 Lamborghinis. I don’t call it money anymore, I call it fuel units. You must have enough fuel units. You must have enough Lamborghinis. You must construct additional pylons.

Fresh off the boat, from reddit, kid? heh I remember when I was just like you. Braindead. Lemme give you a tip so you can make it in this cyber sanctuary: never make jokes like that. You got no reputation here, you got no name, you got jackshit here. It's survival of the fittest and you ain't gonna survive long on 4chan by saying stupid jokes that your little hugbox cuntsucking reddit friends would upboat. None of that here. You don't upboat. You don't downboat. This ain't reddit, kid. This is 4chan. We have REAL intellectual discussion, something I don't think you're all that familiar with. You don't like it, you can hit the bricks on over to imgur, you daily show watching son of a bitch. I hope you don't tho. I hope you stay here and learn our ways. Things are different here, unlike any other place that the light of internet pop culture reaches. You can be anything here. Me ? heh, I'm a judge.. this place.... this place has a lot to offer... heh you'll see, kid . . . that is if you can handle it.

TIL you can lead a meme to water but you can't make it dank

I'm sorry, but this is complete shit and as an established author I will tell you why it is such shit. It should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here, as far as I know. That said. In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it. I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan). I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories. I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it. I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things. I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit "women are crazy" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome. That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that).

Honestly, no hard feelings, but I think I should leave for a while. I don't know how to react whenever I get kicked or otherwise something happens to me. And on the other hand, I think I get kicked way too often, being disrespectful or not. I either do the most autistic and offensive or I don't add much to the conversation at all. I'm probably the most useless member there. And when I'm not crossing the line, I'm basically the buttmonkey of the chat. And whenever I act negatively about something, I end up looking autistic. Honestly, I just feel like I'm either not wanted or I just don't fit in this chat. No one gets kicked more than me. I'm basically Poly. So its safe to say that I should go for a while. And before I leave, and Beanie turns this and my whole chat existence into a meme, let me just say you are one of the most obnoxious posters in that chat. Honestly, I thought you were getting better but you haven't changed. I'm gonna tell you this now: I HATE YOU. I hate you! There, I've said it. I honestly think this chat would be so. much better without your presence. I might be the most useless poster, but you're not far above me. Okay, bye.

Bernie Sanders introduces bill to improve Fallout 4 graphics

™ 

TIFU by finally having the courage to tell my parents that they're gay.

HI GAY PARENTS IM DAD!!! 

TIL a man in Sweden was so fed up that his city wasn't repairing potholes, he went and spray painted pepes on them, earning him the nickname "Danksy"

Bernie Sanders wouldn't have let the potholes happen in the first place for the laundry I will be alright of the girls. But that was in front of the barking dog for you guys And speaking. 

I just had SEX with FALLOUT 4

What the ave did you just fucking say about me, you little degenerate? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Praetorian Guard, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Hoover Dam, and I have over 300 confirmed NCR dogtags. I am trained in Legion warfare and I’m the top arena-fighter in the entirety of Caesar's Legion. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over that pip-boy? Think again, dissolute. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of frumentarius across the Mojave Wasteland and your location is being traced right now so you better prepare for the cross, fool. The cross that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, profligate. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of Caesar's Legion and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what Mar's retribution your little “cowardly” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. Degenerates like you belong on a Cross. Ave true to Caesar. 

Hey you.

W E W L A D E W L A D 

My [17f] best friend [68m] of 18 years wants to be more than friends, what should I do?

DUMP HIM right now!!?!? WHy are you even with him when he treats you this terribly? YOU DESERVE $100% better than this! You deserve a real man who will go down on you whenever you please!  Edit: this.

I downvoted the 'B' 

TIL you can lead a meme to water but you can't make it dank

I'm sorry, but this is complete shit and as an established author I will tell you why it is such shit. It should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here, as far as I know. That said. In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it. I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan). I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories. I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it. I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things. I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit "women are crazy" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome. That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that). I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments). And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator. All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me? 

Reddit has donated a total of $400,000 to Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. The senator's response? "Thanks for the gold, kind stranger."

Tapeworm dies after man inside him gets John Cena

HI GAY PARENTS IM DAD!!! 

TIFU By wearing pants to school

Honestly, no hard feelings, but I think I should leave for a while. I don't know how to react whenever I get kicked or otherwise something happens to me. And on the other hand, I think I get kicked way too often, being disrespectful or not. I either do the most autistic and offensive or I don't add much to the conversation at all. I'm probably the most useless member there. And when I'm not crossing the line, I'm basically the buttmonkey of the chat. And whenever I act negatively about something, I end up looking autistic. Honestly, I just feel like I'm either not wanted or I just don't fit in this chat. No one gets kicked more than me. I'm basically Poly. So its safe to say that I should go for a while. And before I leave, and Beanie turns this and my whole chat existence into a meme, let me just say you are one of the most obnoxious posters in that chat. Honestly, I thought you were getting better but you haven't changed. I'm gonna tell you this now: I HATE YOU. I hate you! There, I've said it. I honestly think this chat would be so. much better without your presence. I might be the most useless poster, but you're not far above me. Okay, bye. Feel free to turn this into a copypasta or whatever.

Oh no don't get me wrong, I enjoy your posts. Honestly I don't get why people give you and the former GallowBoob so much shit when your content regularly makes up their front page. I dunno man. People cry out that the issue is it isn't "OC", well fuck me then, 90% of the website should be shutdown then. This is a content aggregate site, not a starving artist page. I enjoy seeing what you post.

Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories. I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it. I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things. I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit "women are crazy" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome. That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that). I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments). And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator. All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me? 

My [17f] best friend [68m] of 18 years wants to be more than friends, what should I do?

Reddit has donated a total of $400,000 to Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. The senator's response? "Thanks for the gold, kind stranger."

Here in my garage just bought this new Lamborghini here. Fun to drive up here in the hollywood hills. But you know what I like a lot more than knowledge? This new Lamborghini here. But you know what I like a lot more than the new Lamborghini here? My TEDx talk where I talk about this new Lamborghini here. In fact, I’m a lot more proud about these 7 new hollywood hills that I had to get installed to hold 2000 new Lamborghinis. It’s like what the Buffet Warren billionaire says, “The more you earn, the more you drive up here in the hollywood hills.” In fact, the real reason I keep this Lamborghini here, is that it’s a reminder-- a reminder that dreams are still possible. Because it wasn’t that long ago that I was in a little Lamborghini, sleeping on bookshelves in the hollywood hills with only 47 billion dollars in my bank account, and only 47 Lamborghinis in my Lamborghini account, and only 47 hills in my hollywood account, and only 47 TEDx talks where I talk about Warren Buffets in my TEDx talks where I talk about Warren Buffet account. But you know what? Something happened that changed my life. I bumped into a Lamborghini, and another Lamborghini. A few more Lamborghinis and I found 5 Lamborghinis. I don’t call it money anymore, I call it fuel units. You must have enough fuel units. You must have enough Lamborghinis. You must construct additional pylons. 

Hey you.

I just had SEX with FALLOUT 4

What the ave did you just fucking say about me, you little degenerate? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Praetorian Guard, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Hoover Dam, and I have over 300 confirmed NCR dogtags. I am trained in Legion warfare and I’m the top arena-fighter in the entirety of Caesar's Legion. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over that pip-boy? Think again, dissolute. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of frumentarius across the Mojave Wasteland and your location is being traced right now so you better prepare for the cross, fool. The cross that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, profligate. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of Caesar's Legion and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what Mar's retribution your little “cowardly” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. Degenerates like you belong on a Cross. Ave true to Caesar. 

Bernie Sanders introduces bill to improve Fallout 4 graphics

It should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here, as far as I know. That said. In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it. I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan). I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across.

You're not going to like this response, but in the spirit of transparency, what you are saying is definitely not requested by the majority of Hearthstone players. This does not mean that we don't care about it, in fact, we have mentioned many times that we are working on our communication, but we simply don't have any meaningful updates at this time. If you simply want us to acknowledge that we are still working on it, then here you go: We are still working on it.

I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it. I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things. I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit "women are crazy" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome. That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that). I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments). And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator. All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me?

TIL that Applebee's first opened inside the great pyramids due to it's large grain storage capacity. --Dr. Ben Degrasse Carson.

Disclaimer: I'm a guy and this guide is intended for other guys. Ladies, a google search for similar treatments will turn up results for lady bits. Also, I'm not a doctor so do this at your own risk, blah blah blah First of all, if you haven't gotten your Gardasil HPV vaccine, FUCKING DO IT RIGHT NOW. Unfortunately, I caught them before the vaccine was around and have been struggling with them my entire adult life. What I learned pretty quickly is that friction causes the warts to re-emerge, so make sure you use lots of lotion when masturbating and (for men) lubricate your penis before you put on a condom. (It feels better during sex too). Apple Cider Vinegar Method Materials: Medical tape, cotton balls, apple cider vinegar I tend to get warts on my shaft and this method works great to get rid of them, typically in less than 24 hours Do this in this 2-3 hours before bed. Tear a piece of medical tape off that should circle the circumference of your penis twice. Get a cotton ball, place it on the top of your apple cider vinegar bottle and turn it over until roughly half the cotton ball is soaked. Hold the cotton ball onto the affected area firmly (but not enough that the vinegar squeezes out) and with your other hand wind the tape around the cotton ball so that the cotton ball hugs the affected area tightly. After an hour, take off the cotton ball and tape and you should see that all of the warts will be pale in color. This makes them more pronounced and easier to apply your second application. Repeat steps 2-3 every hour to make sure the warts receive a constant burn from the vinegar. At bedtime, apply your final cotton ball to your love bumps and wish them goodbye. (I wouldn't recommend applying freshly soaked cotton balls more than four times, otherwise it will damage healthy skin.) When you wake up, most or all of the genital warts will have formed scabs on them. This means they've been eliminated. There might be some light scabbing that occurs on healthy skin, but they should go away in a few days and will not cause scarring. Apply Neosporin to the scabbed-over dead warts as needed and it should heal up in one and a half to two weeks. Note: This method works great on small warts but often fails to completely get rid of clusters of warts that have grown together into a super-wart. Please refer to my next guide on how to get rid of bigger ones. For ladies or men with awkwardly-placed warts, refer to this guide on how to make an apple cider vinegar paste. Also, I've heard that putting an apple cider vinegar soaked cotton ball in the vagina for inner warts will get rid of them. At Home Cryogenic Treatment Materials: Dr. Scholl's Freeze Away/Compound W FreezeOff/Any generic pharmacy brand of the latter products, q-tips Use any sort of vinegar applied to a cotton ball and hold them down on the wart(s) for 5-10 minutes in order to contrast them against healthy skin. You can use the applicator included with the product, however these are intended for foot warts and I've found that they're too large to use on genital warts. I use Compound W FreezeOff and found that normal size q-tips fit right into the large q-tip applicator included with the product after you cut off one end of the q-tip. I'm not sure about other products, but you have to somehow manipulate the device to releases the freezing gas onto the q-tip. Put the q-tip into the freezing gas for 3 seconds, as the instructions say. Hold the frozen q-tip onto your wart for 5-7 seconds. This will hurt. DO NOT DO IT FOR 20-40 SECONDS AS INSTRUCTED BY THE PRODUCT. That applies to feet, not genitals. When you take the q-tip off, the wart should be completely white. This means that you've effectively frozen it off. By the end of the day, if you've successfully killed the wart it should turn a dark grey/blackish color. They will eventually fall off, scab over and heal. Use Neosporin to hasten the healing process. I hope this helps everyone. Any feedback, alternate methods, or your experiences with these methods would be appreciated.
