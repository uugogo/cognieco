I'd rather Pete snatch a young, forward thinking, innovative, and crafty coach from the college ranks rather than look at a re-tread.

Not likely, we don't have much cap space at all, I think we have like 600k.

Lockette Injury: Observation of the play.

I think a lot of teams have been doing stuff like this to us. Lockette is such an amazing gunner that teams have had to game plan on minimizing is effect, which is why he has seemed less effective lately.

 The Seahawks have gained more than 100 yard rushing in every game this season, and are riding a 19-game streaj of 100-plus rushing games, the longest such streak in the league.   damn, i had no idea.. and some of those games, I cant imagine how we put together 100!

Never a good time for an injury, but if one's gonna happen, right before the bye is the time for it.

 @MoneyLynch You talking about Ricardo Lockette, the guy who cost you a chance at a TD at the end of the Super Bowl?  -‏@DamnSon29 wow... what an ass. 

PFF on what we already know - Sherman back to his shutdown form.

Sherm played beautiful today outside of that stupid hold on Lockett's punt return. Dez was almost playing more defense on Sherman than the other way around lol 

It's a concussion, full range of movement.

Just playing devils advocate here but this weeks performance, as stellar as it seemed, was against an injured Bryant being thrown to by Matt Cassel. They didn't exactly look like world beaters. 

[Condotta] Wilson says Lockette said "do it for me Russ" as carted off.

If something like this has to happen, it probably couldn't have happened at a better time. Going into the Bye, he's got two whole weeks to get evaluated and get better. As well, PRich is primed to make his comeback as well, so it's almost balances out. Lockette can be a hot headed penalty magnet sometimes, but he's a great athlete and has been a solid member of the Seahawks family for years. I hope he gets better and hope he gets his chance at Super Bowl redemption that he's been yearning for since February. Get well soon, Rockette.

Absolutely ridiculous, especially when you throw in how few offensive holding calls our defensive line has received. Frankly it's offensive. 

The wait is officially over! First game back on the field at home after bye week! 😁😁 - Paul Richardson

If this is truly official then I am pumped! It's safe to say we might not see him too much for a while though to be on the safe side. 

So, we have all this talk about how well Sherman played, but you know who we aren't talking about?

And the o-line? Zero sacks on Russ this game. That's gotta count for something, eh? 

ZERO sacks!!!

I'm gonna give him the benefit of the doubt, and say that when he was arguing with the officials and giving some lip about the flag, he wasn't aware of how serious the situation was. He seemed pretty passionate after the game when he realized how the media was spinning that story. Although, I don't know shit. 

Today, Marshawn Lynch surpassed 9,000 Career-Yards.

Still hoping he can get 10k before he hangs it up.

If this is truly official then I am pumped! It's safe to say we might not see him too much for a while though to be on the safe side. 

How does the injury to Lockette (thoughts and prayers) affect the prospect of a trade from WR depth for o-line help?

Positives -No sacks allowed! -Defensive lock down Negatives -Only 13 points scored -Red Zone offense -Haush$ won't be perfect this year. :( It will be hard to win many more games only scoring 13 points. Dallas D was ranked in the bottom of the league before this game as well.  

Ok, so what does it mean that we just beat the Cowboys by one point?

It means we've found the active roster spot that Paul Richardson is going to take. In a brutally honest way, keeping Richardson inactive for this last game and now having an open spot once Lockette hits IR means we have kept whoever was going to be cut had Richardson been active this last game.  

So, we have all this talk about how well Sherman played, but you know who we aren't talking about?

Marshawn is the best teammate to have. Stays with you while your down, gives advice on savings and 401Ks, shakes your hand like a class act after a TD and to top it off he will never go to the media with anything

Opponent Audio Recap, Cowboys Extended Edition

Wow. Classy guys those radio announcers. Much better than the Patriots ones. I remember listening to the Patriots ones when Wilson played them his rookie season, and they said something like "Wow, losing to the 32nd ranked starting quarterback in the league, you made him look like Doug Flutie out there." 

Don't count out the Seahawks yet, the 4 teams they lost to are a combined 24-4 and 3 of those 4 losses were on the road.

yes yes but the fact is we gotta play better especially with the hole we dug ourselves. We aren't counted out solely because of our record, it's mostly because of our play 

ZERO sacks!!!

Justin Britt had a +3.8 PFF Grade, Alvin Bailey holding down left tackle...How did this happen?

Wilson's gutsy performance keeps Seahawks in playoff chase

 The Seahawks have gained more than 100 yard rushing in every game this season, and are riding a 19-game streaj of 100-plus rushing games, the longest such streak in the league.   damn, i had no idea.. and some of those games, I cant imagine how we put together 100!

Seahawks v. Cardinals BYE WEEK THREAD

Cardinals lurker here. I feel that the biggest factors for the Seahawks is who is the best matchup for Floyd, Fitz, Nelson, and Brown without their speed burning the defense out, as well as whether the Seahawks D-line can get to Palmer. When Palmer gets a lot of pressure, he starts to throw like a 35 year old qb.  Our pass rush is very sub par, and we will likely do to Wilson what we did to Kaepernick, which is not chase the qb, but prevent the qb from getting extra yards from scrimmage. Your best bet will likely be dump passes to the rb which has been killing us all year.  edit: Fumbles and drops. When the Cardinals fumbled the ball we lost games we likely would have won otherwise. Knowing the Seahawks like to strip balls this will be very important to the game as well. 

What the experts think

With half a season done, this is my seeding:    New England Patriots   Cincinnati Bengals   Denver Broncos   Indianapolis Colts*     New York Jets   Pittsburgh Steelers     Carolina Panthers   Green Bay Packers   Arizona Cardinals   Philadelphia Eagles     Atlanta Falcons   Seattle Seahawks   *These are all the teams that I feel are better deserving to a playoff spot than the Colts:   Oakland Raiders   St. Louis Rams   New York Giants   New Orleans Saints   Kansas City Chiefs   Minnesota Vikings   Buffalo Bills   Miami Dolphins   

The Seahawks have 6th-best 3rd down defense in the league.

The only thing this game impacts is the NFC playoff race, so I suppose a packers win is better if seattle wants home field, but considering we probably won't be able to gain the #1 seed in the NFC (not saying we can't just not likely) as a team Seattle is probably best off with Carolina as the number one, the pack have one of the better home field advantages in the league, and we've won in Carolina in recent memory. So all in all it really doesn't matter to Seattle much in the grand scheme of things, except for who the NFC goes through in the playoffs

Russell Wilson: 11 4th Quarter Comebacks and 16 Game Winning Drives are tied for most in NFL history thru first 4 seasons

I think Seahawks have done a good job meshing Graham into their offense. He is on the pace of reaching 900 yards (more than last year) in 76 catches (fewer than last year).  

Wilson's gutsy performance keeps Seahawks in playoff chase

Bye week: C-C-C-C-Combo Breaker!

Coach question

Hopefully he doesn't break this record. I'd rather be winning by 30 points in 4th quarter, thanks. 

Pep Hamilton

 The Seahawks have gained more than 100 yard rushing in every game this season, and are riding a 19-game streaj of 100-plus rushing games, the longest such streak in the league.   damn, i had no idea.. and some of those games, I cant imagine how we put together 100! 

Lane returns to practice next week

Brian Schneider, Special Teams Coordinator 

PFF ranks the 32 offensive lines

At first glance, no.  I'm no football concepts guy (so I may be spewing nonsense), but I'm not sure the Stanford system would mesh well if Cable was still in charge of the O-line, in addition to the zone-read plays we currently run. 

What the experts think

Gonna really need him on special teams with Lockette out.

Seahawks v. Cardinals BYE WEEK THREAD

I think all it takes us for us to beat the Cards both times and the NFC-W can be ours. The Cards can be as high powered on O and solid on D as they want, but at the end of the day losing to us twice gives them 4 losses, and they still have to play the Bengals, and the Packers, both teams I expect them to lose to. That gives them 6 freakin losses. Even if we lose 2 more times (lets say Rams and Vikings) we have the tie breaking 2 wins against the Cards to take the NFC-W.  So I am not scared, I think we come out in classic second half Seahawk fashion and start to get on a roll, beating the Cards, 9ers and Steelers at home. We go on the road and beat the Ravens and Browns, then come back home and play a tough game against the Rams that we pull out like last season, and then it is the final Cards game. With the NFC-W champion title on the line, with making the playoffs or not (or at least seeding) on the line, does anyone thing we let the Cards pull out that win?  I'm not worried. Per usual the national media is high on the Cards and looks down on us, but per usual we will get on a roll and start to look scary and our D will start doing amazing things and our O will start to win by more than a TD and the national narrative about the Seahawks will change.  All it takes is us going up against the Cards and making them look like a solid but not great team and us getting the win and all of a sudden 50% of these national media guys tunes change.  

Midseason review

Yeah but first contact has to be averaging like two yards behind the line of scrimmage. 

The Seahawks have 6th-best 3rd down defense in the league.

Cardinals lurker here. I feel that the biggest factors for the Seahawks is who is the best matchup for Floyd, Fitz, Nelson, and Brown without their speed burning the defense out, as well as whether the Seahawks D-line can get to Palmer. When Palmer gets a lot of pressure, he starts to throw like a 35 year old qb.  Our pass rush is very sub par, and we will likely do to Wilson what we did to Kaepernick, which is not chase the qb, but prevent the qb from getting extra yards from scrimmage. Your best bet will likely be dump passes to the rb which has been killing us all year.  edit: Fumbles and drops. When the Cardinals fumbled the ball we lost games we likely would have won otherwise. Knowing the Seahawks like to strip balls this will be very important to the game as well. 

In 14 more pass attempts Russell will be sitting right around that number 8 spot on this career leaderboard. He's currently at 64.3% over his 1486 attempts.

Clearly his shaking my hand this past off-season is the reason for this. No need to thank me.

Wasn't aware of this and he does make an important point: Blandino has never officiated an NFL game.  “Yet Blandino is now the sole decider of what is and isn’t a catch, of what calls will and won’t be overturned on replay.”

With half a season done, this is my seeding:    New England Patriots   Cincinnati Bengals   Denver Broncos   Indianapolis Colts*     New York Jets   Pittsburgh Steelers     Carolina Panthers   Green Bay Packers   Arizona Cardinals   Philadelphia Eagles     Atlanta Falcons   Seattle Seahawks   *These are all the teams that I feel are better deserving to a playoff spot than the Colts:   Oakland Raiders   St. Louis Rams   New York Giants   New Orleans Saints   Kansas City Chiefs   Minnesota Vikings   Buffalo Bills   Miami Dolphins

Here I make the case on why I think a STL Rams win vs the Minnesota Vikings helps us long term this weekend.

Don't count your commission just yet, he is notorious for returning things. 

Will Ricardo Lockette be placed on IR? If so, who takes his spot on the roster?

Minnesota doesn't scare me. I think they can beat the Rams this weekend, but I have them on 5 game slide with the Raiders, Packers, Falcons, Seahawks, Cardinals.  I think 8-8 will be their final record.

Former NFL official rips Roger Goodell, instant replay

How the hell do you get to be the Vice President of Officiating without ever having reffed a game? That is just absurd. Something needs to be done about the officiating in the NFL though, because it seems to me that this year is worse than usual for bad/missed calls. Seems like every week there is some kind of controversy surrounding the refs. 

Justin Britt Most Improved Guard From 1st Quarter of Season To The Second (PFF)

Am I the only one that noticed there has been a pocket for Wilson on pass plays recently? 

Last year, the Seahawks defense allowed 17 TDs and 13 FGs through 8 games. This season: 12 TDs and 14 FGs.

Hard to evaluate because we played some really great offenses and some really struggling ones.

Fox Sports: NFL "Peter Schrager has 3 reasons why the Seahawks are going back to the Super Bowl!" (Video) [I completely agree with every point he makes]

Does anyone else feel like maybe, just maybe, this bye comes at the best possible time? OL gel time.  Kam learns Richard's defense after holding out.  PRich comes in as Lockette goes out.  Lane comes in as Lockette goes out.  Wilson gets his timing with the TE/WR just right.  Etc.  This is a fantastic time for a bye.

That was fast . . . oh wait, it's Lockette. Of course it was fast.
