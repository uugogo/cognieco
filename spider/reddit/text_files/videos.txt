A super macro video of Soap Bubbles, the intensity of the colours is insane

The perfectly clear regions at the top of the bubbles which appear black because of the dark background are a single molecular bilayer, a fact which was used by Perrin -along with his realization that such layers must definitionally come in discrete unit multiples- in 1913 to give one of the first accurate measurements of the size of an individual molecule: 2.2 nm long in the case of a soap molecule. A feat of insight and experimental brilliance that earned him the 1926 Nobel in physics. 

Norm Macdonald on 9/11

I've seen another moment on his podcast where he simply says "9/11" and everyone loses it. The timing and delivery were just right and it broke an awkward silence and got everyone back into their groove.

How to sound smart in your TEDx Talk

Can speak from experience - absolutely true. Did a TEDx talk back in... 2010? 2011? My head has never been crammed so far up my ass. I'm impressed anyone made sense of it.  TEDx, though officially recognized by TED, obviously isn't vetted nearly as well as true TED events, and thus invites anyone with a mouth and half a brain to bray on and on about shit they will probably never understand. I spoke on procrastination and getting shit done. I still procrastinate and rarely get shit done.

Jaw dropping video shows how many bombs were dropped in Laos by the US Air Force from 1965 to 1973.

What this video doesn't include is the devastating effect the unexploded ordinance left and continues to leave on the civilian population of Laos. It's estimated that around 30% of the bombies from the cluster bombs failed to explode, leaving the country significantly covered in UXO. 20,000 casualties have resulted in the post-conflict era, of which 50% of these are children, some collecting scrap or playing with UOX. Even this year around 300 new casualties are expected.  

This is how you deal with disrespectful students and gain their respect

Wrong.  This is how you deal with disrespectful students AFTER you have gained their respect.  The process of earning respect comes from hundreds if not thousands of smaller interactions, and can't be caught on tape.  If these boys didn't ALREADY respect this man, there's no way he could have diffused the situation.

You enter your seat number into the app so it know's which pixel you are in the crowd and the app syncs the color and timing of the phone screen with all the others. So it ends up looking like this but with no rehearsing required.

This is fucking genius. If this series doesn't continue forever I'm going to be extremely disappointed. Crappie Killer is my new personal hero.

What Does The Poppy Mean?

Beautiful ad. For those like me who wanted to know what the poppy  means:  The red remembrance poppy has become a familiar emblem of Remembrance Day due to the poem "In Flanders Fields". These poppies bloomed across some of the worst battlefields of Flanders in World War I; their brilliant red colour became a symbol for the blood spilled in the war.  It is worn on and around Remembrance Day (The british equivalent to the american memorial day) Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day

Courtroom footage of some of the men who attempted to assassinate Adolf Hitler

He died according to the youtube description:  The trial of some of the resisters featured on Valkyrie. I was editor on the documentary Valkyrie for the History Channel. The men had their belts taken away so they would have to hold their pants up in humiliation. He was taken out and hung by cord as thin as piano wire -- as seen at the end of the movie Valkyrie.  

4 Tape Measure Tricks

Best tape measure trick is extending the tape out as far as you can to see how far you can get it to stay stiff before it flops to the ground.

Wait for the epic ending.

PSA I know some of you may feel a little intimidated by this, but just remember. If you ever get in a fight with an 8 year old that knows martial arts, throw a chair at the kid. 8 year old's are well known for their weakness of chairs flying at their faces.

Courtroom footage of some of the men who attempted to assassinate Adolf Hitler

The story of the Friesler's (the judge) death is quite interesting, he was killed during a bombing raid in 1945 before judging another member of the July 20th plot, Fabian Von Schlabrendorff.  Friesler's corpse was found clutching Von Schlabrendoff's files. Von Schlabrendoff, who almost certainly would have been executed had Friesler lived, survived the war, became a judge himself, and died in 1980
