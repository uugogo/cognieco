I am a physicist currently working in the biomedical engineering field and 90% of my staff are BME's. The feeling toward this discipline is that it is incomplete. Most of the people that I work with come from very prestigious colleges but seem very out of place in an engineering environment. Most engineers that I have worked do not leave college equipped with the practical knowledge that an engineer needs and need to pick this up as part of the job, but with BME's even the fundamentals had to be taught to them on the job. The more capable BME's have voiced regret over their choice in degree. Clearly this discipline is very important, probably now more than ever, so what do you think can or should be done to bridge the gap between biomedical engineering and the more mainstream engineering disciplines?

When they say they will recalculate the reflectivity now that they know the sensors are degraded, how confident can they be in any recalibration?  

Instead of creating high-pressure zones by pushing against the water,jellyfish and lampreys generate areas of low pressure that force water past their bodies, essentially pulling their way through the water. The findings could influence the future design of bioinspired swimming robots.

Electronic skin feels the heat, hears the sound

Stellerators are pretty sweet; I got to see the one at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (for research only, not power generation, but I think they've pumped over a billion dollars into that one as well).  To heat it up, they spin up 6 train engines with 1-ton flywheels, using dynamic braking to power a 10 ns laser pulse (~1 Joule in total) that travels through a vacuum to heat up the gas.  They mentioned that if it weren't a vacuum, and if there were a fly in the way of the beam, the fly would be instantly vaporized and its microscopic pieces would blow apart the stellerator.   Edit: another cool fact about these is that they use explosion welding to form the shape. 

They might sound gross, but intestinal worms can actually be good for you

This may actually explain some issues about attraction relating male/female positions in society.  Women (generally) favor more powerful men because power equals testosterone and testosterone equals sexual success in males. Low testosterone being a risk to both your drive to take on obstacles and to be sexually active. Low testosterone also equals a less masculine physical appearance (low muscle growth, thinning facial hair, etc.) which is an unconscious visual trigger that they aren't the best choice for mating. In women this would be the opposite situation which would lead to men (generally) finding such women less sexually appealing. Why? Women with high testosterone tend to have issues with ovulation and reproduction. They also appear more masculine in appearance (facial hair growth for example) which would signal to a man that they likely won't successfully bear them children.  If you look at this situation from an evolutionary perspective, it explains the likes and dislikes of men and women. It also explains why societies have developed certain "goals" in regards to what men and women aspire to and why there has been a backlash by other populations in society. The groups who have been deemed unsuccessful instead reject the claims in order to make themselves seem appealing as "unique".

Early life stress is a major risk factor for later episodes of depression. In fact, adults who are abused or neglected as children are almost twice as likely to experience depression.

As someone who had a pretty crap childhood, this isn't a surprise. Hopefully it can lead to developing ways to help them heal later in life though.

NASA Study: Mass Gains of Antarctic Ice Sheet Greater than Losses

This is an article that's going to get intensely mis-interpreted by the press and is going to sway public opinion in favor of non-anthropogenic global warming.

For cancer, a natural or synthetic anti-inflammatory, but not both: A synthetic option reduced the cancer fighting effect of a well-known, natural compound found in turmeric.

Turmeric + black pepper is a phenomenal anti-inflammatory with far reaching benefits. Turmeric is a great antioxidant, lots of manganese which the vast majority of people are deficient in. It's also a potent cancer fighter. Buy bulk turmeric/black pepper at your local Arab market. Use a spice grinder to powderize the black pepper. Mix in a 1-1/4(pepper) ratio with hot water, a lil salt, and a lil sesame oil. Strain and drink. I use a blender to maximize the effects. 

Study finds most sleepwalkers feel no pain and remain asleep despite suffering injuries. In addition, sleepwalkers are 4 times more likely than control groups to have a history of headaches, and 10 times more likely to have migraines (after controlling for confounding factors).

Study link: Pain in Sleepwalking: A Clinical Enigma Of particular note are some of the extreme cases mentioned in the article, and quoted below.   For example, one patient sustained severe fractures after jumping out of a third-floor window while sleepwalking but didn't feel the pain until after waking up later in the night. Another patient broke his leg during a sleepwalking episode in which he climbed onto the roof of his house and fell down, but he didn't wake up until morning.  Also note that this study is based on a relatively small sample of 100 or so people. While incredibly interesting and suggestive of analgesic effects of sleepwalking, more study is definitely warranted.

Calcium-48’s ‘neutron skin’ thinner than previously thought

 Researchers at Jefferson Lab are preparing to measure the neutron radius of calcium-48. A team of physicists, the Darmstadt-Osaka Collaboration, has already measured its dipole polarizability and is analyzing the results. The findings could validate the work of Hagen’s team and constrain future theoretical models.  This is probably the most interesting part of the press release to me.  Are there any atomic physicists that can provide a "university physics-level" explanation of this experiment?

I'm sure this happens in all professions. You find more of your own flaws and you work harder. Some people just think they are doing good enough and don't need to improve, so they remain at the level of ability they reached. 

You Probably Use Your Smartphone Way More Than You Think; Many young adults spend a third of their waking lives on their device. New research conducted by British psychologists shows that young adults use their smartphones roughly twice as much as they estimate that they do.

Researchers have established that eggs have a protective 'checkpoint' that helps to prevent DNA damaged eggs being fertilised.

Study link: Early Exposure to Dogs and Farm Animals and the Risk of Childhood Asthma The unprecedented size of this study also allowed the researchers to control for potential confounding variables, such as asthma in parents, area of residence and socioeconomic status. As a result, this is some of the most conclusive research ever presented on the effect of animal ownership early in a child's life on the development of certain disorders.  

Micro photosynthetic power cells may be the green energy source for the next generation

When they say they will recalculate the reflectivity now that they know the sensors are degraded, how confident can they be in any recalibration?  

Omura's whales, recently thought to be extinct, have been found near Madacascar

So what is the loop hole allowing those with genetic defects? The defects do not meet the criteria of the "checkpoint" as damaged?

Aedes japonicus mosquitoes found in western Canada: Canadian entomologists have reported the first appearance of Aedes japonicus - an invasive, disease-carrying mosquito - in western Canada

"Because the species has been reported in Washington state, just 70 miles from the Canadian border, the researchers speculate that the species was brought into Canada as a result of human actions." I don't understand how they come to this conclusion.  Mosquitoes have wings, and feed on the blood of many more mammals than humans.  Nor does border control have a method to stop mosquitoes from crossing.  So, how does the fact that they expanded their population 70 miles mean that humans are at fault?

ACS Science Tuesday: I am Todd M. Przybycien, a Professor of Biomedical Engineering and Chemical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, AMA about Chemical and Biomedical Engineering

I am a physicist currently working in the biomedical engineering field and 90% of my staff are BME's. The feeling toward this discipline is that it is incomplete. Most of the people that I work with come from very prestigious colleges but seem very out of place in an engineering environment. Most engineers that I have worked do not leave college equipped with the practical knowledge that an engineer needs and need to pick this up as part of the job, but with BME's even the fundamentals had to be taught to them on the job. The more capable BME's have voiced regret over their choice in degree. Clearly this discipline is very important, probably now more than ever, so what do you think can or should be done to bridge the gap between biomedical engineering and the more mainstream engineering disciplines?

By age 5 children have a sense of self-esteem comparable in strength to that of adults, a new study shows: Because self-esteem tends to remain relatively stable across one’s lifespan, the study suggests that this important personality trait is already in place before children begin kindergarten

I think the title is misleading because I don't think the author of the article correctly interprets the paper/Dr. Dario Cvencek's interview. The title/article states:  By age 5 children have a sense of self-esteem comparable in strength to that of adults, according to a new study by University of Washington researchers. Because self-esteem tends to remain relatively stable across one’s lifespan, the study suggests that this important personality trait is already in place before children begin kindergarten.  But in the interview, Dr. Cvenek only ever ambigously mentions the connection between 5yo and adult self-esteem as "underscoring the importance":  Self-esteem appears to play a critical role in how children form various social identities. Our findings underscore the importance of the first five years as a foundation for life,”  In fact, this wasn't even a longitudinal study, as the title presumes. Taken directly from the article:  The researchers are following up with the children in the study to examine whether self-esteem measured in preschool can predict outcomes later in childhood  When taking a look at the actual paper (can only see the abstract) it does mention a connection between 5yo and adult self-esteem, but does NOT say anything about how confidence of a 5yo determines confidence of that same child as an adult as the title/article suggests. Abstract excerpt:  By preschool age, children display fundamental properties of adult implicit social cognition that relate to maintenance and functioning of group identities.  So unless I missed something, or the abstract fails to mention a seemingly important insight of the study, then skepticism of the title/first paragraph of the article is well advised

Scientists say Alzheimer's probably a collection of diseases that should be treated separately

Thinking about my own experiences, this makes sense to me.  Constructive coping characterized by dealing actively with a clinical problem, in terms of exercising reflexive control, seeking consultation and problem-solving together with the patient seems to help patients   versus  while coping by avoiding the problem, withdrawing from therapeutic engagement or acting out one's frustrations in the therapeutic relationship is associated with less patient change.  Someone more doubtful of their ability may be more capable of satisfying the former, whereas someone that is overconfident in themselves may be more inclined 'to do what is right for the patient' rather than support the patient and working with them on a more personal level. Doing a good job of taking care of yourself not only reinforces those strategies but provides an empathetic point of view to work with those skills. This is taught as a foundation of patient-centered practice and the development of a successful patient-provider relationship. Of course, it is good to see that practice backed up by more than anecdote, and that the correlation is upheld in controlled studies.

Community College and For-Profit College Graduates Earn Same Hiring Interest from Employers: Researchers found that hiring managers show no preference for hiring people with for-profit college credentials compared to those holding comparable credentials from public community colleges

I went to 16 different public schools before I graduated high school, and in every single one, the school lunch was absolute garbage.  Pizza, french fries, and creamed corn is not a meal. It barely qualifies as food when you look at the nutritional contents. Some schools don't allow kids to bring their own lunch either.  I only went to two like that, and one had such awful food and such strict policy that I had to get a doctor to write a note saying I had special dietary needs since they would not accept my (fabricated) religious exemption. It is even more disheartening when you find out how much the school is paying for those meals and who the money is going to.  If this is what they are taught to eat as children, how can we how to teach the lot of them any good habits?

Annual snow accumulation on West Antarctica’s coastal ice sheet increased dramatically during the 20th century, according to new study published in the American Geophysical Union Journal. The last three decades saw more snow build up on the ice sheet than at any other time in the last 300 years.

 Thomas says: “In this region, the same storms that have driven increased snowfall inland have brought warmer ocean currents into contact with West Antarctic’s ice shelves, resulting in rapid thinning. Thus the increased snowfall we report here has not led to thickening of the ice sheet, but is in fact another symptom of the changes that are driving contemporary ice sheet loss.”

Scarlet fever — a disease making a comeback — may be increasingly antibiotic resistant: In a study published Monday in the journal Scientific Reports, researchers from the University of Queensland caution that the surge in scarlet fever cases may pose an unexpected threat.

The original paper is published in Science, full text here Editor's Summary  Loss-of-function mutations may only produce a mutant phenotype when both copies of the gene are mutated. Gantz and Bier developed a method they call mutagenic chain reaction (MCR) that autocatalytically produces homozygous mutations. MCR uses the initial mutated allele to cause a mutation in the allele on the opposing chromosome and thus the homozygosity of the trait. MCR technology could have broad applications in diverse organisms.  Abstract  An organism with a single recessive loss-of-function allele will typically have a wild-type phenotype, whereas individuals homozygous for two copies of the allele will display a mutant phenotype. We have developed a method called the mutagenic chain reaction (MCR), which is based on the CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing system for generating autocatalytic mutations, to produce homozygous loss-of-function mutations. In Drosophila, we found that MCR mutations efficiently spread from their chromosome of origin to the homologous chromosome, thereby converting heterozygous mutations to homozygosity in the vast majority of somatic and germline cells. MCR technology should have broad applications in diverse organisms.

New research suggests hallucinations can occur in relatively healthy people

 Leading causes of death were suicide, alcohol and drug poisoning, and liver diseases and cirrhosis.   

People who live alone are more likely to have unhealthy diets lacking key foods, research has found. The study reported inadequate cooking skills, no partner to go shopping with, the increasing cost of food and a lack of motivation to cook were among the reasons.

Gut bacteria can help treat cancer

No motivation to cook when it is only for yourself. 

A species of cricket can regenerate an amputated leg. Researchers have now identified the crucial genes involved in the epigenetic processes that allow this to happen.

Im glad to not be a part of that statistic. I was just under 100 lbs before I had my first daughter in 2006...I had gained around 20 lbs with each of my four girls...now Im stuck at a very squishy 130 lbs. Booooo.  

Science AMA Series: I’m Laura Salazar, associate professor of health promotion and behavior at the School of Public Health at Georgia State University. I’m developing web-based approaches to preventing sexual assaults on college campuses. AMA!

I'm a sucker for good news, but between this, viral drug delivery methods, and gene editing, I feel like we're finally closing in on a lot of cancers. 

Gut microbes give anticancer treatments a boost

In your research, what factors have you found that lead to sexual violence on campuses? What seems to be the prevalent attitudes toward sexual assault on college campuses? My son is in college, and he and I have had a couple of conversations about this topic. He has told me he thinks sexual assault numbers are inflated and that some (not all) women use it to hide mistakes or "get back at" the guy.  I would be interested to hear if that attitude is normal on college campuses and how it should be addressed.  

Rat poison at marijuana farms is killing increased numbers of rare forest mammal

 illegal marijuana grow sites  This problem is only illegal grow sites, not 'marijuana farms'.  So this is another problem caused by prohibition. People that grow professionally don't do this.  Mods, mark this shit as misleading title 

Annual snow accumulation on West Antarctica’s coastal ice sheet increased dramatically during the 20th century, according to new study published in the American Geophysical Union Journal. The last three decades saw more snow build up on the ice sheet than at any other time in the last 300 years.

 Thomas says: “In this region, the same storms that have driven increased snowfall inland have brought warmer ocean currents into contact with West Antarctic’s ice shelves, resulting in rapid thinning. Thus the increased snowfall we report here has not led to thickening of the ice sheet, but is in fact another symptom of the changes that are driving contemporary ice sheet loss.”  

Being moody may help us adapt to change - A new theory published November 3 in Trends in Cognitive Sciences argues that mood draws on experiences and can, in fact, help us quickly adapt to changes in our environment.

 According to current theories, agents can maximize reward by keeping track of how much reward is obtained in each experienced state of the environment, and then choosing actions that return them to the states in which such reward has been most abundant [7, 8]. For example, an animal using such a mechanism can learn which specific trees bear more fruit and focus its foraging efforts accordingly. This type of ‘reinforcement learning’ algorithm [9] constitutes a powerful way to learn about the environment and converges upon optimal behavioral policies (e.g., [61]). However, there are many real-world situations for which such an algorithm may be poorly equipped. We propose that the information represented by mood is used to mitigate problems that arise in the application of reinforcement learning to such real-world problems. One such learning inefficiency arises when changes in reward in different states are correlated. For instance, increased rainfall or sunshine may cause fruit to become more abundant in all trees simultaneously. In this situation, it makes little sense to update expectations for each tree independently, and a more efficient learning algorithm would instead infer a general increase in reward and update expectations for all related trees accordingly. We suggest this is the function of mood. If fruit becomes more abundant in all trees, a foraging animal will be positively surprised multiple times as it visits adjacent trees and, as a result, its mood will improve. Improved mood will bias the subjective reward for each subsequent fruit upwards, and because these observations are used to update expectations, expectations associated with these trees will be adjusted upwards more rapidly than they would be otherwise. In essence, the effect of positive surprises will be enhanced as more positive surprises are encountered.  I like the idea of mood states helping in reinforcement learning that the authors of the original article propose.  

Study shows that strength of brain connections in older adults varies with levels of cardiorespiratory fitness

Direct link to article Abstract  Greater physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with reduced age-related cognitive decline and lower risk for dementia. However, significant gaps remain in the understanding of how physical activity and fitness protect the brain from adverse effects of brain aging. The primary goal of the current study was to empirically evaluate the independent relationships between physical activity and fitness with functional brain health among healthy older adults, as measured by the functional connectivity of cognitively and clinically relevant resting state networks. To build context for fitness and physical activity associations in older adults, we first demonstrate that young adults have greater within-network functional connectivity across a broad range of cortical association networks. Based on these results and previous research, we predicted that individual differences in fitness and physical activity would be most strongly associated with functional integrity of the networks most sensitive to aging. Consistent with this prediction, and extending on previous research, we showed that cardiorespiratory fitness has a positive relationship with functional connectivity of several cortical networks associated with age-related decline, and effects were strongest in the default mode network (DMN). Furthermore, our results suggest that the positive association of fitness with brain function can occur independent of habitual physical activity. Overall, our findings provide further support that cardiorespiratory fitness is an important factor in moderating the adverse effects of aging on cognitively and clinically relevant functional brain networks.  So basically, your brain gains correlate to your cardiopulmonary gains, directly related to fitness level not necessarily activity level. Not a huge surprise, but Fergalicious and Broseidon would be proud. 

New results from NASA's MAVEN spacecraft suggest that Mars lost most of its carbon dioxide-dominated atmosphere - which had kept Mars relatively warm and allowed the planet to support liquid surface water - to space about 3.7 billion years ago.

So solar winds blew away the atmosphere? Would an expert ELI5 please? :) Also, how does this apply to earth? Like, does this help shape how much time we have until the same thing happens to our planet? 

Researchers discovered why a few minutes of High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) could produce similar results as much more time consuming endurance training

Journal with evidence for HIIT increasing performance I'm a third year Sport and Exercise Science student and currently undertaking a HIIT training protocol for research. I have been placed in the high intensity interval training program which is being undertaken now. The exercise consists of 3 x 4 minutes of high intensity cycling at 90-95% heart rate max (220bpm-age) interspersed with 3 minutes of 70%HRmax between each interval. This has be to done 3 times a week for 4 weeks (currently in the third week) so overall consisting of 21 minutes of cycling per session. The other group also participating are working at a much lower continuous intensity 60-70%HRmax for 45 minutes, 3 times a week for 4 weeks. Before the training program was started we completed a ramped VO2max test till exhaustion to find out the intensity to work at as well as to record any differences in before and after the program. I would recommend this training to anyone, I can already feel the difference and it makes you feel great after. I'm using the training program as well as my normal running routine for preparation for a half marathon so it better work! 

Religious kids are harsher and less generous than atheist ones, study says

I feel concerned about the fact that the goodness of fit in the study is so low.  Things that were inversely predictive of children’s altruism:  frequency of religious practice: r = .161 household spirituality: r = .179 overall religiousness: r = .173  I'm not a social sciences guy, but I know that in any physics experiment I've done, if I gave results with a goodness of fit that low I'd be laughed at. Just look at the plot. I'm having a lot of trouble being convinced that this study predicts anything at all.  EDIT: Fixed bullets
