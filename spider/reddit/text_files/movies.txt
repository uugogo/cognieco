What is something that never fails to break the immersion in a movie for you?

When there is a chase scene, and it is clearly shown how far away the runner and the chaser are from each other, but then it cuts to a different shot, and they are either far closer or further away from each other then they were in the previous shot.  

What's the scariest movie you've seen without any jump scares?

Recently saw Bone Tomahawk and was surprised how it was marketed as a horror film with a western setting, but it's probably more of a western with a horror twist. There are some scares that will make you jump, but no actual jump scares complete with loud sudden noises. I highly recommend it. 

What horrible movie could have been saved by changing one small thing?

I don't really know that this would have saved the movie, but my wife talked me into watching Twilight 2 with her. I was not enjoying it as such, but I was doing OK until the scene where Kristin Stewart fell off a motorcycle and got a scratch, and the werewolf guy rips off his whole fucking shirt to wipe off the blood, and coincidentally show off his rippling abs. That was the end of any possible objectivity and I smoldered with hate for the rest of the movie. Such a ridiculous scene. 

Top 40 Films from Japan

‘Mad Max’ Director George Miller On Sequel, Charlize Theron & No Mel Gibson

I really liked Furiosa, and Charlize as Furiosa. But I really hope she doesn't have a main role in the new one. Her story was resolved in the last one, and I'd be happy if they left it there.  

As someone who dislikes horror/slasher films, I found Tucker and Dale vs. Evil to be absolutely fantastic. Are there any other movies like this?

That's not a horror flick in the strict definition.  But if you like that then try  Zombieland & Shaun of the Dead. Edit: Also try What We Do in the Shadows. Edit 2: Lost Boys. 

Box Office Week: It is the worst weekend of the year at US box office as both Burnt (#5, $5.0 mil) and Our Brand is Crisis (#8, $3.4 mil) flop. Brighter days are on the horizon though as Spectre has beaten Skyfall as the biggest opening week in UK box office history, scoring £41.7 mil ($63.8 mil).

Is it just me, or has 2015 had way more flops than most years? Off the top of my head, we've got:  Fantastic Four Steve Jobs We Are Your Friends Burnt Our Brand is Crisis The Walk American Ultra Pan  Some of these were pretty high profile projects. EDIT  Jupiter Ascending Tommorowland The Last Witch Hunter Aloha Crimson Peak Jem & the Holograms Rock the Kasbah  Current standing at 15 flops.

‘The Peanuts Movie’ Review: 3D Snoopy Toon Is Fan’s Best Friend

Growing up, Peanuts was mine and many others go-to source of entertainment. It was funny, contemplative and had this wonderful sense of melancholy that really spoke to me [and of course many others]. Peanuts understood that simplicity was key, and in this day and age of bigger and better, I really need some. Basically, I fucking love Peanuts. 

Of all the animated movies that get tons of love, why none for Megamind?

I fricken' loved that movie. It doesn't need a sequel, but the original was amazing. Super fun, lot's of energy and a great cast. Has a proper redemption story that doesn't feel forced, and of course the music is AMAZING. 

Breaking Down Indiana Jones' Character Arc Through All His Films

This was a fun read.  I like how the writer says that you can learn more about character building and storytelling from studying all of the Indian Jones than you can from 10 years of film school.  I doubt that's true, but it's an entertaining sentiment.

Your favorite movie soundtrack

What is the best acted scene in cinema history?

I'VE ABANDONED MY CHILD 

This movie trailer was accidentally released with no soundtrack. It proves how important music really is

No.  Lack of music isn't the problem.   It's the lack of ambient sound.   This was likely a voice over track to make sure you hear the star's voice.   Basically a redub.   But lack of music isn't the strange part here....  It's lack of any sounds at all.

‘Mad Max’ Director George Miller On Sequel, Charlize Theron & No Mel Gibson

I'm glad Mel Gibson won't be appearing in any newer Mad Max movies. I feel that cameos are a huge distraction from films and they temporarily take the viewer away from the plot. Cameos usually make for an awkward chuckle, making it difficult to readjust to the storyline. Whatever seriousness the movie used to have is now gone because the viewer is taken from what the director is telling us as being real to "Hey, remember that guy who used to act as the main character 30 years ago? Well, now he's gas station attendant and he said something funny! Haha"  

What horrible movie could have been saved by changing one small thing?

I don't really know that this would have saved the movie, but my wife talked me into watching Twilight 2 with her. I was not enjoying it as such, but I was doing OK until the scene where Kristin Stewart fell off a motorcycle and got a scratch, and the werewolf guy rips off his whole fucking shirt to wipe off the blood, and coincidentally show off his rippling abs.

Snoopy Gets a Star on Hollywood’s Walk of Fame

YES!  IT'S.ABOUT.TIME!!!  I've waited my entire life for this man, it's so well deserved!  Snoops should have had his star in the 70's, had the g-damn industry not been dominated by Walt and Warner.  It's a travesty honestly, but I'm glad he's getting it.  He truly deserves it!  Keep those movies coming!  We all enjoy them so much!   

What deleted scene should have been kept in the final version of the movie?

Independence Day where it's explained that all modern technology was reverse-engineered from the Area 51 spaceship and that's why Jeff Goldblum is able to hack into it & fuck up the force fields. 2 hrs and 25 min and they couldn't find time for a scene that makes the entire climax make more sense. 

Box-Office Surprise: 'Steve Jobs' Performing on Par with Ashton Kutcher's 'Jobs'.

 "Often, sophisticated, intellectually charged movies like Steve Jobs have a tough time gaining huge acceptance by a general audience — they play well in the major cities and among the intelligentsia and then have a tougher time gaining acceptance in wide release," said Rentrak's Paul Dergarabedian. "That said, it's a great movie, and its box-office performance should not impact its Oscar prospects. After all, it's the Oscars, not the People's Choice Awards."  What a stuck-up statement that is. On top of just being fucking insufferable, he's in denial if he thinks the Oscars aren't affected by popularity or box-office results. 

'The Lobster' Leads British Independent Film Awards Nominations

i live in australia and the lobster came out this week. i traveled to a cinema well out of my way and was overcharged to sit in a tiny theatre with old couples around me. nevertheless im glad i did because this was the most unique movie ive ever seen and it deserves our money and recognition. also im happy to see ex machina up there. 

The original Japanese Godzilla (1954) turns 61 today. Here's a great article on the making of the film

I feel like most people don't take this film seriously enough. The original Japanese cut of Gojira is really, really good. It utilizes real footage from the Hiroshima aftermath in a way that works exceptionally well.  

Kung Fu Panda 3 | Official Trailer #2

The hesitation in this thread so far is HERESY! I fucking LOVE the Kung FU Panda movies, and this looks like more of the same. It's a pretty poorly-cut trailer, but the content looks like it's gonna be just like the last two. The action sequences in the KFP movies are the best animation has to offer, the voice acting is always great, and now we've got Bryan Cranston, JK Simmons, and a finale which I can only assume will be an army of panda warriors kicking some ass. I'm excited. If you're not excited, well no need to rain on my panda parade. 

As someone who dislikes horror/slasher films, I found Tucker and Dale vs. Evil to be absolutely fantastic. Are there any other movies like this?

‘Mad Max’ Director George Miller On Sequel, Charlize Theron & No Mel Gibson

I really liked Furiosa, and Charlize as Furiosa. But I really hope she doesn't have a main role in the new one. Her story was resolved in the last one, and I'd be happy if they left it there.  

Key and Peele Team with Henry Selick for stop-motion movie Wendell and Wild

I know I'm the minority here but, I really look forward to a key and peele movie. 

I watched 25 Bond movies in 13 days. Here are some of my thoughts.

If it's the casino Royale I am thinking of, it's not really a bond movie as such. It's more like Austin Powers before Austin Powers. Whenever I watch a couple of the older Bond films, I am always struck by how little effort some of them make to even be a coherent film. Probably more directed at the Roger Moore era silliness than the early Connery stuff. Still love them mind you. In some ways, I feel like the modern films are the most serious attempt to actually have a story and characters. 

What film in the past 10 years would you rate a 0/10 absolutely unwatchable?

DragonBall Evolution

Roman Holiday will be playing at select AMC theaters Nov 29th and Dec 1st.

I'm beyond excited to see this in theaters. 

What film in the past 10 years would you rate a perfect 10 out of 10?

Danish movie The Hunt (Jagten)  starring Mads Mikkelsen. This is the most spine chilling, edge of the seat movie I have seen and it's not even a thriller in the conventional sense. Mads Mikkelsen is simply outstanding, he is definitely one of best actors of this generation.  

Which actor have you seen the most on screen at the cinemas?

Ian Mckellen for me.. Fellowship of the ring Two Towers Return of the King Da Vinci Code Xmen 2 Xmen days of future past The Hobbit an unexpected Journey The Hobbit the desolation of Smaug The Hobbit the battle of the five armies 

So i watched ex machina last night

Oscar Isaac's character was fantastic Great moment

Could not find english subs....seems to mostly be in french 

What movie does everyone else like that you think is pure and utter shit?

Ellen Burstyn's monologue in Requiem for a Dream is one of the best acting performances I have ever seen [SPOILERS]

Why did the success of the Lord of the Rings films not cause an upshoot in high fantasy film productions the same way Star Wars did to space opera and sci fi productions?

The main thing it did was cause them to try to turn every fantasy property into Lord of the Rings. Big battle scenes in Alice in Wonderland and Wizard of Oz movies? Not coming out of nowhere. 

The Man from UNCLE was better than I thought it would be.

The scene where he eats that sandwich is one of the sexiest things I've ever seen. 

Official Images of the Emotions that didn't make it into Pixar's 'Inside Out'

Some other emotions that didn't make the final cut: Pride, Envy, Gloom, Despair, Depression, Love variation 1 and variation 2, Guilt, Schadenfreude (the enjoyment that comes from seeing others' troubles), Ennui (the feeling of listlessness or dissatisfaction) and Hope. Greed, Irritation, Shame and Embarrassment. Edit: Added new images. 

The facial expressions in this scene from Burn After Reading kill me. George Clooney does a hilariously good job playing a paranoid loon.

I think one of the greatest facial expressions ever made is when Brad Pitts' character surprises Clooney in the closet. I die laughing everytime I see that.

I really do hope this movie breaks the whole "Video game movies are terrible" trope. If Warcraft becomes a successful movie franchise, the possibility of watching Arthas' story arc on the big screen would make my inner 12 year old self so happy.

New movies on home video for November 3, 2015

Anybody see Mistress America yet? I liked Noah Baumbach on The Squid and the Whale but really disliked Margot at the Wedding and Greenberg.  

Box Office Week: It is the worst weekend of the year at US box office as both Burnt (#5, $5.0 mil) and Our Brand is Crisis (#8, $3.4 mil) flop. Brighter days are on the horizon though as Spectre has beaten Skyfall as the biggest opening week in UK box office history, scoring £41.7 mil ($63.8 mil).

Did anyone else even see Our Brand Is Crisis? I was surprised there wasn't even a discussion post for it. 

Official Images of the Emotions that didn't make it into Pixar's 'Inside Out'

Some other emotions that didn't make the final cut: Pride, Envy, Gloom, Despair, Depression, Love variation 1 and variation 2, Guilt, Schadenfreude (the enjoyment that comes from seeing others' troubles), Ennui (the feeling of listlessness or dissatisfaction) and Hope. Greed, Irritation, Shame and Embarrassment. Edit: Added new images. 

A Documentary about how Making a Big Budget Movie went horribly wrong (Making of Babylon AD)

Could not find english subs....seems to mostly be in french 

Yesterday i watched American Psycho for the first time..

When it all comes down to it, the purpose of the movie is to drive the appreciation of Huey Lewis and the News 

Last night I watched "What We Do in the Shadows."

"Leave me to do my dark bidding on the Internet" "What are you bidding on?" "I am bidding on a table." 

The Man from UNCLE was better than I thought it would be.

This movie really made me want to see Cavill as Archer if they ever made a live action movie. I know it'll never happen, but it'd be cool. 

The facial expressions in this scene from Burn After Reading kill me. George Clooney does a hilariously good job playing a paranoid loon.

I think one of the greatest facial expressions ever made is when Brad Pitts' character surprises Clooney in the closet. I die laughing everytime I see that. 

Anyone else fondly remember The Whole Nine Yards? Fantastic comedy about hitmen with Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis before he gave up on having hair.

Love it. Perry x Willis is a great combo. 

What books do you recommend to better enjoy movies?

Making Movies by Sidney Lumet. Director of 12 Angry Men and Network, among others. Very insightful and easy to read book on the process of filmmaking, especially if you're a fan of his work. 

40 years ago today, Pier Paolo Pasolini was murdered (or perhaps assassinated). Masturah Alatas writes a fascinating piece on Pasolini's most controversial film, perhaps the greatest film ever made on the psychology of fascism and torture: Salo: or the 120 Days of Sodom.

I saw this on laserdisc back in college (the only available format at the time).  It's supremely upsetting, not just because of the subject matter, but because of the technique.  I'll go ahead and be the contrarian here and say that it's a triumph of technique: the elegant, classical compositions are just daring you to find it beautiful while the things that happen on the screen, um, happen.  The movie is interested in making the audience complicit in the torture on screen, and every time I admit that it's beautiful to myself, it succeeds.

What's the scariest movie you've seen without any jump scares?

Lake Mungo - Don't think there are any jump scares, just general spookiness and many spine chilling moments 

'Wild Tales' helmer to write and direct Mark Wahlberg in 'The Six Billion Dollar Man'

After Wild Tales I'll watch anything by the guy, easily one of the best movies I've ever seen 

What is your favorite musical number scene from a non-musical?

This is easy. Puttin on the Ritz  from Young Frankenstein. In fact I'll go watch it right now... won't you join me? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1FLZPFI3jc 

Metroid: The Sky Calls

I like the grainy 80's sci-fi presentation, they used their budget well. The acting is awful. 

What is a common movie criticism that annoys you?

My dad has a horrible habit of sleeping through 1/3 of a movie (or more) and then saying "It wasn't any good," or worse, "It didn't make sense." Makes me so frustrated. 

13 years later,''Reign of Fire'' still holds title for best CGI dragons ever on screen.

I've always like the way the dragons 'leak' fire. Very original and very cool. 

Jan Harlan's 1976 note to Stanley Kubrick introducing him to the Steadicam

Really cool. It's interesting to see the similar benefits of Steadicam to newer systems like Movis and Ronins.

Key and Peele Team with Henry Selick for stop-motion movie Wendell and Wild

Of all their interesting characters they have to do a movie about the chose those two? 

A cartoon featuring the first Disney character, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, is to be screened for the first time in 87 years.

He looks like Mickey Mouse to me.  

The original Japanese Godzilla (1954) turns 61 today. Here's a great article on the making of the film

I feel like most people don't take this film seriously enough. The original Japanese cut of Gojira is really, really good. It utilizes real footage from the Hiroshima aftermath in a way that works exceptionally well.  

Box-Office Surprise: 'Steve Jobs' Performing on Par with Ashton Kutcher's 'Jobs'.

 "Often, sophisticated, intellectually charged movies like Steve Jobs have a tough time gaining huge acceptance by a general audience — they play well in the major cities and among the intelligentsia and then have a tougher time gaining acceptance in wide release," said Rentrak's Paul Dergarabedian. "That said, it's a great movie, and its box-office performance should not impact its Oscar prospects. After all, it's the Oscars, not the People's Choice Awards."  What a stuck-up statement that is. On top of just being fucking insufferable, he's in denial if he thinks the Oscars aren't affected by popularity or box-office results. 

The McDowell's restaurant from "Coming to America" became a reality in Chicago for Halloween.

Paul Rudd and Alexander Skarsgard cast in Duncan Jones' 'Mute'

Jones just announced on twitter that Clint Mansell is doing the score and Sam Rockwell is involved in some capacity. Honestly cannot wait for this film, been hearing about it for years now. 

Internal Sony communications indicated that "Spectre" star Daniel Craig and the movie's director Sam Mendes were both opposed to multimillion dollar product placements for Sony or Samsung Android phones because it could tarnish the suave image of James Bond.

So... what about those Heineken ads that I was seeing all the time a year ago?  Or this one that's from two months ago. 

David Lynch Talks 'Eraserhead' in Uncovered Lost Interview From 1979

Ah man, now you made me think about Eraserhead, now I'm gonna have to watch it again and make myself miserable. 

What's the saddest scene that doesn't involve a death?

Schindler's List, when he breaks down at the end. Requiem for a Dream, her monologue about not wanting to be alone. Those are the 2 big ones for me. 

As someone who dislikes horror/slasher films, I found Tucker and Dale vs. Evil to be absolutely fantastic. Are there any other movies like this?

That's not a horror flick in the strict definition.  But if you like that then try  Zombieland & Shaun of the Dead. Edit: Also try What We Do in the Shadows. Edit 2: Lost Boys. 

There’s Going to Be a Lot More Quicksilver in the Next X-Men.

I expect a post puberty reduction in his speed. Otherwise he is plot-breakingly strong. 

'There and Back Again', the 3-hour cut of the Hobbit films, isn't perfect. But it is magical.

I'm gonna wait for the third extended edition, then check out fan edits. I'm sure this guy will make an even better one when he gets a little more to work with. 

Chi-Raq Trailer

If you didn't already know, the main plot is based on the Ancient Greek play Lysistrata  Here's a quick summary from Sparknotes Lysistrata has planned a meeting between all of the women of Greece to discuss the plan to end the Peloponnesian War. As Lysistrata waits for the women of Sparta, Thebes, and other areas to meet her she curses the weakness of women. Lysistrata plans to ask the women to refuse sex with their husbands until a treaty for peace has been signed. Lysistrata has also made plans with the older women of Athens (the Chorus of Old Women) to seize the Akropolis later that day. The women from the various regions finally assemble and Lysistrata convinces them to swear an oath that they will withhold sex from their husbands until both sides sign a treaty of peace. 

Shane Carruth has assembled an impressive cast for his latest movie project, The Modern Ocean - Anne Hathaway, Keanu Reeves, Daniel Radcliffe, Chloe Moretz and Jeff Goldblum will star, based on Carruth's 200-page script that is described as being filled with pictures and diagrams.

I'm just happy Carruth is acting in it. 

Kung Fu Panda 3 | Official Trailer #2

The hesitation in this thread so far is HERESY! I fucking LOVE the Kung FU Panda movies, and this looks like more of the same. It's a pretty poorly-cut trailer, but the content looks like it's gonna be just like the last two. The action sequences in the KFP movies are the best animation has to offer, the voice acting is always great, and now we've got Bryan Cranston, JK Simmons, and a finale which I can only assume will be an army of panda warriors kicking some ass. I'm excited. If you're not excited, well no need to rain on my panda parade. 

Ralph Fiennes: 'Lego Batman' Finds Its Alfred.

I find it funny how Hollywood seems to insist that only Oscar-caliber actors can play Alfred Pennyworth on the big screen.   Michael Caine, Jeremy Irons, and now Ralph Fiennes.  That's pretty damn good casting for a butler. I hope this trend continues, and Alfred becomes one of the most coveted film roles in history.

‘Mad Max’ Director George Miller On Sequel, Charlize Theron & No Mel Gibson

I really liked Furiosa, and Charlize as Furiosa. But I really hope she doesn't have a main role in the new one. Her story was resolved in the last one, and I'd be happy if they left it there.  

Topher Grace is editing the Hobbit movies into one film just like he did with the Star Wars prequels

Not asking for someone to link it or anything, but has anyone actually seen his Star Wars edit, or is it completely hidden from everyone?

I couldn't tell if I was supposed to take the movie seriously.  At first it seemed like a parody, then it got kind of serious. The trailer I mean.

 Also, this is Christopher Nolan's favorite Bond film.  That probably explains the snow fortress scene in Inception.

What methods do you use to choose which movie to watch?

I usually search out recent discussion/review threads in film subreddits, or look at a list of the latest Blu-Ray releases. If nothing there sparks my interest, I'll choose a genre, find a trailers playlist on YouTube (ie. 2012 Action Movie Trailers) and then randomize it.

Wilson being left behind 

Henry Selick, director of stop-motion classics Disney’s “The Nightmare Before Christmas” and Laika’s “Coraline,” is developing a new stop-motion feature with Key & Peele.

 After “Coraline,” Selick spent two years developing his original story “The Shadow King” with Disney, but Disney ultimately decided not to go forward with the film. “Originally much darker, it became the story of a shy boy who learns to use his ridiculously long fingers to make living hand shadows and ultimately save his jealous brother from a shadow monster,” explains Selick.  Seriously, I always wondered what Selicks been up to.. Love his work. Shame on Disney.

I'd also like to throw in a recommendation for For Your Eyes Only. I really do think it has some of the best practical effects sequences in the Bond canon including amazing helicopter stunts, classic ski chases, a very tense rock climbing stunt, and Topol almost dying from a real explosion. It's a damn good time.

Theme of the Moment: Bond. James Bond.

As well as recommending a movie for us, /u/getfreecash also sent me some fun facts about each movie to share. Couldn't fit them in the post but here they are! You Only Live Twice  Lewis Gilbert (director), Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman (producers), Ken Adam (production designer), and Freddie Young (cinematography) were supposed to fly from Japan back to the UK on a BOAC Boeing 707 flight (BOAC Flight 911) on 5 March 1966, but chose to miss the flight after being told they had a chance to watch a ninja demonstration. (Ninjas > everything else.) BOAC Flight 911 crashed into Mount Fuji 25 minutes after takeoff, killing all on board. Sean Connery was disillusioned and tired of playing James Bond by the time YOLT rolled into production; Connery found it difficult to do other work and feared typecasting. Producers Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli were able to persuade Connery by increasing his fee for the film, but the relationship between Connery and the producers deteriorated to the point where he refused to act if the latter two were on set.  Live and Let Die  United Artists lobbied hard for an American to play the role of James Bond in this film. Among the American actors considered were Clint Eastwood (Bond uses a Dirty Harry-esque Magnum in this movie, though), Burt Reynolds, Paul Newman, and Robert Redford. Julian Glover is British but was also considered for Bond in this film – he later went on to play Kristatos in ​For Your Eyes Only​. Yaphet Kotto was not allowed to do any press for the film or attend the premiere because producers were afraid of the public's reaction to the Bond villain being black. When LALD was released in South Africa (which was still under apartheid law at the time), all of Bond and Rosie Carver’s love scenes were removed. Paul McCartney's salary was so high that a composer could not be hired with the remainder of the music budget – which is how George Martin, McCartney's producer while he was still with the Beatles, ended up scoring the film. Elsewhere, Sean Connery was offered a then-astronomical salary of $5.5 million to reprise his role as James Bond in this film. EON probably should have fired whoever was in charge of payroll for this movie.  Never Say Never Again  This is the last movie in Sean Connery's career to show him clean-shaven, with no beard or mustache whatsoever (​Dragonheart​ doesn’t count). I just love the idea that someone probably went through Connery’s entire filmography solely to look for the presence of facial hair. NSNA is actually the film that inspired the “No animals were mistreated or harmed in the making of this film” disclaimers we see in movie end credits nowadays, because a stunt that involved a horse jumping off a cliff caused controversy among animal rights activists.  Quantum of Solace  In an early draft of the screenplay by Paul Haggis (before the writers’ strike – Haggis was also offered the director position at one point), Bond would have discovered in this film that his girlfriend Vesper Lynd had had a child (but not one fathered by Bond, obviously). Guillermo del Toro and Alfonso Cuarón appear in cameo roles. Cuarón appeared briefly as a Bolivian helicopter pilot, while del Toro provided voicework. Oona Chaplin plays a hotel receptionist. Marc Forster is the first (and, to date, only) director of the EON Productions Bond films who is not from a Commonwealth nation; Forster is Swiss. It was his idea for the primary action sequences to be based around the four classical elements of earth (the Siena foot chase), water (the boat chase in Haiti), air (the plane dogfight – which Forster intended to be a homage to ​North By Northwest​), and fire (the solar-panelled hotel)  On Her Majesty's Secret Service  The film doesn't have a theme song with vocals, only an instrumental theme, because composer John Barry felt it would be too difficult to write a (non-operatic) theme song containing the words “on Her Majesty’s secret service” in it. (Seriously, what the hell rhymes with service?) This was obviously years before people realized it didn’t matter if the theme song had a different name than the title. OHMSS is, to date, the last time a Bond film has used an instrumental as the theme song. George Lazenby is the youngest actor to portray James Bond; he was 29 at the age of filming OHMSS. A then 22-year-old Timothy Dalton was also asked to star in this film, but he turned it down as he believed he was too young and inexperienced to be able to step into Sean Connery’s shoes. Adam West was also offered the role of James Bond because he was a personal friend of Albert R. Broccoli.  License to Kill  The film was originally supposed to be set in China, with a chase sequence along the Great Wall and a fight scene amongst the Terracotta Army. Franz Sanchez and his nefarious schemes are based on real examples of Manuel Noriega’s exploits, according to writer/producer Michael G. Wilson. Robert Davi based parts of his portrayal of Sanchez on the character of Le Chiffre from “Casino Royale”. Hilariously, a bunch of thugs actually took Davi to meet a real drug lord when the actor was later vacationing in South America, because said drug lord liked Davi’s role in ​Licence to Kill​. Budget restraints were imposed on LTK (as had been the case with every Bond film since ​Octopussy​) because the producers were still paying interest on ​Moonraker​’s huge budget. This is what happens when you send Bond to space, people.

I fucking hate Xavier Dolan because he makes me feel worthless. Dude is, what, 25? And he was already on the Cannes film jury and has made 5 critically acclaimed movies, all of which he wrote and directed. I feel confident in saying he's gonna try to get up there with the likes of Bergman and Goddard, the type of filmmaker who just pumps out extremely high quality films 

Roger Ebert on Little Indian, Big City (1996): "There is a movie called Fargo playing right now. It is a masterpiece. Go see it. If you, under any circumstances, see Little Indian, Big City, I will never let you read one of my reviews again."

I like Gene Siskel's line: "If the third reel had been the missing footage from Orson Welles' 'The Magnificent Ambersons,' this movie still would have sucked." 

'Girl With the Dragon Tattoo' follow-up in works, will be a reboot with new cast

No Rooney? No Craig? NO FINCHER? This SUCKS. 

Shane Carruth has assembled an impressive cast for his latest movie project, The Modern Ocean - Anne Hathaway, Keanu Reeves, Daniel Radcliffe, Chloe Moretz and Jeff Goldblum will star, based on Carruth's 200-page script that is described as being filled with pictures and diagrams.

I'm just happy Carruth is acting in it.

Michael Cera, Samuel L. Jackson and Michelle Yeoh have joined the voice cast of Blazing Samurai, an animated feature inspired by Mel Brooks' comedy classic Blazing Saddles. Rob Minkoff, director of The Lion King and Stuart Little, will produce the animated comedy.

A gender-flipped ‘Ocean’s Eleven’ won’t solve Hollywood’s sexism problem.

The fact that gender-flipping movies is a thing is sexist. Can we not write female led movies so we have to remake other movies with women in those roles instead? Not only does it seem sexist, it also looks lazy and if performs badly I fear will be attributed to sexism rather than being a tired and boring concept.

I'm actually looking forward to a different story in this universe. I like wizards getting into shenanigans. Especially if it involves fantastic beasts.  Edit: I do worry a bit about Yates directing though.  Could be too gloomy and lacking in the action department as well since he loathes set pieces. The script being written by Rowling should allow for plenty of whimsy to find its way through the visuals though.

Theme of the Moment: Bond. James Bond.

I'd also like to throw in a recommendation for For Your Eyes Only. I really do think it has some of the best practical effects sequences in the Bond canon including amazing helicopter stunts, classic ski chases, a very tense rock climbing stunt, and Topol almost dying from a real explosion. It's a damn good time.

One of the best and most uplifting pieces of cinema. Sam's speech from The Two Towers.

Fun fact - this scene was not in the book.   Fact: The hobbits are not taken to Osgiliath at all and instead are simply let free from Henneth Annûn (the Gondorian hideout with Faramir). Fun: When Samwise speaks the lines 'by rights we shouldn't even be here' early in this scene.  This is of course a nod to the change from the book.   In the movie, bringing the Hobbits (and Gollum) to Osgiliath on the western shore of the Anduin river, which would have been reached by openly crossing the river, would have exposed them and the Ring to capture. My opinion: The scene is good, Sean Astin is great.  I find it almost too sad and tearjerking to call it uplifting though.

I've loved that movie for ages and ages. CHHHAAAAARRRRRRRRGE! Check out The Lady Killers (the one with Alec Guiness from 1955, not the awful remake from the 90s) for a similarly dark sort of movie.  And you have a good bet just searching for "Cary Grant" on imdb and picking at random. They're all great.

How did you make a movie? If know this question sounds  dumb.  I'm a senior in high school and when I grow up, I want to make movies. It just seems impossible.

2015's movie scheduling was just dumb. Spread some of these out over the year.  Sometimes in the midst of summer, I'd like to see something without a CGI slugfest or entire city being destroyed. But at the same time, i can't see every one of these movies in the amount of time they're in theaters.  It's like they said, "Let's take ALL the movies geared towards people over the age of 22, and release them all in 2 and a half months. But only keep them in theaters 2 or 3 weeks."

Blade Runner’s abandoned endings - Deckard's journey from human to replicant

From reading this I can see where they were implying Deckard to be a replicant, but I sort of think it all works better if he isn't really a replicant. He's "programmed" in the sense that he's been trained to kill and that's all he can do, that in killing replicants he loses what makes him human. I wonder if the sequel will try to keep things ambiguous or come right out and say he's a replicant.

London Has Fallen Official Trailer #1 (2015)

Looks pretty bad. I'm totally going to see it.  

Of all the amazingly hilarious (and yes, over-the-top) scenes in "The Birdcage," this touching scene where Williams and Lane discuss their relationship at a bus stop gives me the biggest smile. "I'm 50 years old, there's only one place in the world that I call home and it's because you're there."

I absolutely love Hank Azaria in this movie. 

Largest Police Union Cautions Quentin Tarantino: We've Got a Surprise Coming For You.

 "The right time and place will come up and we'll try to hurt him in the only way that seems to matter to him, and that's economically,"   Their boycott isn't going to impact the box office of this movie at all, and what kind of moron announces that they have a "surprise" anyway??  "Something is in the works, but the element of surprise is the most important element"  MOTHERFUCKER YOU JUST ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE!

Hey /r/movies, we are Aaron Hann, Mario Miscione, and Michael Nardelli and we just made a movie called Circle which is out on Netflix right now! We are ready for an AMA so enter the Circle and ask us anything!

Did you make it and get to sell it to Netflix? Or did you pitch to them and they financed it for you/made it Netflix exclusive? Did you guys have agents broker everything, or did you do it yourself? (Im so curious about how the whole Netflix thing works, as far as the mechanics of them acquiring things) Last question, what kind of cameras/lenses did you shoot on? (I rent Alexa's & Red's and plenty of glass for a relatively small company, if you ever need gear down the road give me a shout) Thanks, hope it does well.
